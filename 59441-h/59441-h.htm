<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>An August night! Hot with the fever of her
adolescence as a national capital, Buenos Aires
was ablaze with millions of lights and rejoicing in
noisy revelry.</p>

<p>The Centennial festivities had been going on
since May. Thousands of people had flocked in
from every corner of the country, from neighboring
states and even from Europe. During these
great days of a nation's coming of age, the crowd,
in one enormous, slowly moving procession,
thronged the asphalt pavements of the principle
avenues. The very streets and houses appeared to
be in motion. When, toward evening, the multitude
increased, the congestion caused a swelling which,
it seemed, must at a given moment burst the bounds
on either side. At night some forty theatres, and
innumerable movie-houses and concert halls,
crammed overflowing masses into their hungry
maws, while in the cabarets boisterous licence rubbed
elbows with curiosity.</p>

<p>The cabaret, of "the Port"&mdash;as Argentina calls
its chief city&mdash;is a public dance hall: it provides a
room, tables for drinking, and an orchestra. The
patrons are young men of the upper classes with
their mistresses; tourists and rustic sight-seers; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
girls "of the town," who come alone. The tango,
almost the only dance seen there, and the orchestra,
composed usually of white gangsters and mulattos
are&mdash;with the champagne bottle and the tuxedo&mdash;the
normal expressions of the Argentine suburban
"soul"!</p>

<p>The musicians sing, shout, strike on the wooden
pans of their instruments, gesticulate. The silhouettes
of the dancers twist and intertwine, weave
in and out across the floor, blend, and neutralize each
other; and the mandola, with its dark low tones,
underlines the tangos with long shadows of pain.</p>

<p>But there are other things in the cabaret besides
dancing. On some nights a sudden outburst of
noise, from end to end of the hall, cuts the tango
in two, as it were, with an enormous, quivering gash.
A man's persistent ogling of another fellow's girl,
a violent collision of dancers, the suspicion of ridicule
or insult, bring threats from mouths contorted
with anger, while revolvers are flourished in the air.
The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patota</i>, the inevitable leading actor in such
scenes, is a group of wealthy roisterers whose greatest
pleasure is to annoy, insult, attack with fist or
weapon, in short, transform peaceable pleasure
seeking into a tavern brawl. To show resentment
toward a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patota</i>, to resist its aggressions, is to invite
a drubbing from a pack trained to fight as a gang,
or an unfailing bullet fired treacherously from
behind.</p>

<p>On that August night, in one of these crowded
cabarets, frenzied dancing was going on. Some
gigantic invisible hand seemed to be reaching down
from the top of the hall, and incessantly stirring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the couples round and round. All the tables were
full. Champagne bottles raised their aristocratic
necks from the icy prisons which held them. Under
the glow of the lights evening gowns blazed dazzlingly,
and the women's flesh shone gleaming, vibrant,
golden, from the low cut dresses. Tangos,
tangos, more tangos! With the speed of a movie
film, and in chance groupings, graceful poses and
involuntary caricatures were sketched. The musicians,
caught up in the madness of the throng,
shouted phrases of double meanings caught up for
the purpose from the latest song hits. A couple
of "professionals" suddenly emerged, amidst wild
applause, from the common herd of the dance,
which opened from the centre to make way; and
there, surrounded by a ring of faces, incited by
exclamations, admiring and picturesque, the two
embraced, separated, and came together again, interminably,
with minutely patterned steps and attitudes,
to the music of an uneasy, sensuous, odorous
tango, which the mandola tried to sentimentalize
with the wails of its deeper notes.</p>

<p>When the exhibition was over, many eyes turned
toward a man sitting alone at a little table, conspicuous
because he was so gloomy and preoccupied, so
completely indifferent to everything that was going
on around him. He was well dressed in a black
suit that suggested both elegance and severity. His
face attracted; magnetic, it might have been called;
here, one felt, was a personality, a man who had
fought his way up in life through suffering. His
features wore an expression of mental and moral
disquietude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Unaccompanied save by his own thoughts, he
was, nevertheless, furtively watching a young girl
who, with several other people, sat at a table near
by. This man was not in nor of the cabaret. When
his gaze was not fixed on his pretty neighbor it
seemed to be seeking distant worlds, wandering,
perhaps, in search of something to fill his solitude
or to offer to this girl in one single passionate
glance.</p>

<p>The youths with whom she was sitting formed a
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patota</i> of five. She was dividing their attentions
with three other women at the table. The men did
not belong to aristocratic society, though they were
of "good family" as the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">porteños</i>&mdash;the people of
Buenos Aires&mdash;say; the names of their fathers',
that is, were well-known in politics and business,
and appeared frequently in the society columns of
the newspapers. As individuals they had no distinction.
They talked in loud, obtrusive voices, using
terms of gross familiarity in addressing one another.
When they laughed it was in a bellowing
hilarity calculated to attract attention; just as, when
they danced, it was with tremendous waggles of
hips and shoulders. Of their champagne they were
noisily ostentatious. It was now mid-winter in
Buenos Aires; but they were wearing light suits and
flashy neckties. Typical Argentine "sports" in
short!</p>

<p>The girl, who had so impressed the solitary
stranger, was taking no part in the animation around
her. Her quiet melancholy shadowed a rather long
face, a pair of burning dark eyes, a mouth that might
have been called too large. Everything about her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
contributed to the tragic attractiveness of her person:
the wide hat, which accentuated a child-like
quality in her; the elegance, somewhat affectedly
careless, of her dress; the relaxed indifference with
which she moved her long arms&mdash;thin but shapely,
and covered, to above the elbow, by white gloves.
The low cut of her dress drew one's eye to the faint
golden tints of her skin. Her hair, of a dull golden
shade, fell in loops over her ears to form a frame
for her features.</p>

<p>He observed that she was vainly trying to be
merry, and to laugh with her companions; but depression
had obstinately seized on her, and she
lacked the will to master it. A moment came when
her gloom increased to the point of tears, and her
companions remarked it. One of them, in whom
drink was already at work, cried out:</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you? Have you got
the pip?"</p>

<p>He was a graceless individual, ugly, flat-nosed,
restless, loud-voiced, constantly gesticulating, whom
the others called "the Duck."</p>

<p>His friends greeted this witticism with bursts
of laughter. The girl herself forced a smile in
which the man at the neighboring table caught something
of her suffering. His facial muscles contracted
slightly.</p>

<p>"Give her another swig of booze&mdash;it's good for
what ails her!" bawled the "Duck," inspired by
the success of his previous venture.</p>

<p>"Don't mind him, Nacha!" said one of the women
coldly, not as much from real sympathy as from
a sense of feminine loyalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Again there were outbursts of laughter in the
group, and even from people at other tables who
had begun to listen. The girl, embarrassed, mortified,
looked timidly about in every direction. When
her eyes met those of the man who was sitting alone
her self-consciousness increased.</p>

<p>The orchestra came to the end of a tango and,
in the quiet which followed, the members of the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patota</i> set out to "rag" Nacha. One of them, who
seemed to be her "man," egged the others on. The
women playfully sided against her. Soon almost
all the cabaret was taking part in the game. At
last Nacha, unable to endure the banter longer,
laid her face in her hands. The "Duck" moaned
in burlesque: "Oh, Oh, Oh!" while some of the
spectators near by almost unhinged their jaws in
a roar of laughter, or chorused with the mourner
in ridicule: "Oh, Oh, Oh!"</p>

<p>"See here, you are making a fool of me in public!"
exclaimed Nacha's lover&mdash;and he added an
oath.</p>

<p>Again the orchestra struck up a tango. The
languid notes, the limping rhythms, the thick, bee-like
murmur of the mandola, came to drown both
curses and laughter alike. Again the couples were
out on the floor, here swinging together in tight
embrace, there stilting along with bodies stiffly erect
and faces grave.</p>

<p>Nacha's "man" got up to dance with her. When,
however, the girl resisted, he lifted her violently in
his arms and set her down in the middle of the
hall.</p>

<p>"Let me alone! I can't dance...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are going to dance, I tell you.... You
are only putting on!"</p>

<p>"But don't you see? I can't ... oh, please!"</p>

<p>The fellow grasped her around the waist and
plunged with her into the rhythmic whirl on the
floor. The man who sat alone had started at the
brutality he was witnessing, as though a question
had suddenly been settled in his mind. Something
dramatic seemed about to happen, and many eyes
watched him uneasily.</p>

<p>Nacha, with no heart for the dance, was not long
in freeing herself and returning to the table; now
it was quite unoccupied, since all her companions
were on the floor. Her escort followed smiling
with rage, and sitting down beside her, began apparently
to insult and threaten her. His lower jaw
was thrown far forward as he spoke; his teeth came
tight together, and his lips twisted themselves into
all the grimaces expressing anger and contempt.</p>

<p>"You'll pay for this ... as soon as we get out
of here!" he said; and meanwhile he clutched her
arm in a grip that hurt.</p>

<p>The stranger was now looking closely at the man.
The latter was a tall strapping fellow, stockily built.
His wide, close-shaven face showed a scar across the
chin. He had broad shoulders, a dark skin; and
his small hard eyes glittered with something of an
Indian's haughtiness and sinister ferocity. A large
pearl adorned his made-up necktie. He wore white
spats over his patent leather shoes, and large rings
on his fingers.</p>

<p>There are plenty of men like this among the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">porteños</i>! As vulgar as they are rich, they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
always showing off their dollars and their women.
They each set up a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage</i> with some pretty girl&mdash;for
otherwise they would lose "standing." They
spend their evenings in the theatres and their nights
in the cabarets or, for adventure, ragging with
their pals and their sweethearts some convenient
victim; drinking champagne, making an uproar, annoying
everyone, bellowing at one another. Noisy,
aggressive, intrusive, they allow no one to look
too pryingly, too persistently, at them! Their
right forefingers itch for the feel of a revolver&mdash;an
appendage that Nature should, to please them,
have grown on their right hands. Women, in their
eyes, are mechanical toys, objects without human
feelings, to be bought and sold as such. And yet
women become attached to them; perhaps because
they like the manliness that such violence attests;
or because these fellows show their women off, give
them distinction&mdash;of a certain kind. Passion also
inclines them to a certain fidelity at times. Some of
them moreover are university men, or belong to
prominent families. However, they are all office-seekers,
all gamblers. They "go across" to Europe
occasionally, insulting well-bred people by their arrogance
and their grossness as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouveaux riches</i>. In
Paris they are always accompanied by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocottes</i>, and
make disturbances in dance halls and cabarets to
advertise their South-American spirit and self-sufficiency.
A repulsive type, in short: a mixture of
the barbarian and of the civilized human being, of
the gangster and the respectable citizen. The urban
descendent of the Argentine cow-puncher is an individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
without scruples, morals or discipline, with
no law but caprice, and no ideal but pleasure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nacha, her face in her hands, was
weeping. Her tormentor grew angrier, raised his
voice to a higher, more resonant pitch, threatened
her still more violently, called her hysterical, ridiculous,
said she was surely "kidding." Anything
would succeed better with him, he shouted, than
cry-babying, and putting on.... At the single
table near by, the stranger was looking on intently,
his features tense with silent determination. How
much longer could a self-respecting man hold out
against the challenge of that brutality?</p>

<p>The rapier-thrust of a violin bow gave the death
stab to a dying tango. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patoteros</i> and their
women returned to their table. The fellow who
had wept vociferously before broke out again into
mock lamentations at sight of Nacha's tears. He
stood up, rubbing his fists into his eyes, and bawling
grotesquely, like the dunce in school. His mirth
caught the mood of the entire cabaret. Every atom
of it quivered in titters of laughter. The butt of
all this humor, hardened by this time, was shedding
her tears inwardly now. She even feigned indifference,
shrugging her shoulders and forcing her lips
into an expression of disdain. But the man who was
watching saw confessed suffering in her still reddened
eyes.</p>

<p>When the next tango crushed this wretched farce
under its innumerable feet, another of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patota's</i>
members, a tall thin youth, with a girlishly slender
waist, asked Nacha to dance with him.</p>

<p>"I said I didn't want to dance!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"What?" Her lover sprang toward her and
seized her by the arms, determined to force her
to her feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, please! I can't! ... I can't!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;'can't'!"</p>

<p>The contest lasted only a second. The man won,
inevitably. Pulling the girl out of her chair he
dragged her along to the centre of the room, so
that his friend could have a dance with her. But
in his anger he gave one push so violent that she fell
to the floor.</p>

<p>And then something unheard of happened. The
man who was alone had risen suddenly at the beginning
of the struggle. Now, to the stupefaction of
everyone, he stepped coolly forward. The crowd
quivered with excitement. A ring of uneasy faces
formed around the chief actors in the scene. The
tango was broken off; the sombre moan of the mandola
was all that remained of it.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" the girl's lover spat at
him, while a leer of primitive hatred flashed in his
Indian eyes, now smaller and harder than ever.</p>

<p>The coolness of the intruder amazed the crowd.
He faced the fellow calmly and addressed him with
apparent indifference. Nothing but a jerking of
his lip muscles and a slight trembling of his hands
betrayed the indignation in him. He looked steadily
at the man in front of him and said slowly:</p>

<p>"You will please stop ill-treating this girl!"</p>

<p>No one could tell whether such coolness were
due to foolhardiness or to real courage. The man
was of average, if not less than average build, easy
picking, obviously, for that semi-Indian and his pals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
who could finish him off in a jiffy, with fists or revolvers,
as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patota</i> preferences and custom might decide.
The other members of the party meanwhile stood
about in paralyzed amazement that any one should
presume to call one of their fellows to account.</p>

<p>"What's that?" the fellow asked, as though he
had not heard distinctly.</p>

<p>"Stop ill-treating this...."</p>

<p>A sudden attack from the four other members of
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patota</i> cut off the end of his sentence. At the
same moment the onlookers discreetly drew back.
A chair was knocked over. There was a rush to
get out through the narrow doorway.</p>

<p>"Hold on there! Leave this fellow to me!"
roared Nacha's owner. The air was dotted for a
moment with clenched, up-raised fists. Seeing his
friends still hedging the intruder about, their eagerness
to attack unappeased, the fellow pushed them
back one by one toward their table. Then he
wheeled around on the spectators.</p>

<p>"This is nothing to stop dancing for, gentlemen!"
To the musicians he shouted: "Go on with the
music! Give us a tango!"</p>

<p>The orchestra, which had disintegrated during
the scene, assembled around the music-stands again.
After a few moments of aimless strumming it began
a dance in quick time. The crowd, partly out of
respect for the bully, and partly out of anxiety to
dance down an incident which, if repeated, could
only end in a shooting, began another tango. No
one cared to return to a danger once safely passed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two men stood facing one another.</p>

<p>"You don't know me!" said the girl's lover at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
last, pulling at the rings on his fingers as though
to busy his hands, so eager to be at the throat of
the man opposite him. "You don't know me&mdash;but
I know you! You are Dr. Fernando Monsalvat.
Well sir, let me give you a suggestion. Leave us
alone, and get out of here at once. You are older
than I&mdash;forty at least. I am only thirty, very fit,
and used to these affairs; and my friends are with
me, their sleeves rolled up already, you might say.
Just go along home! Don't be throwing your life
away! And if I give you so much good advice
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gratis</i>, it's because I have my reasons for doing so!"</p>

<p>The fellow's friends looked at one another inquiringly.</p>

<p>Who could that man be? What reasons did their
comrade have to prevent them from breaking the
presumptuous fool's head? The girl, seated at the
table, kept her eyes on her champion. The orchestra
was playing a wailing dance, limping with pauses,
and mournful with the sighs of the mandola. There
were many couples dancing, the women clinging to
their partners' necks.</p>

<p>Monsalvat heard the man out in silence. He
replied coolly:</p>

<p>"You can keep your advice to yourself! Meantime
I want you to stop ill-treating that poor girl!"</p>

<p>"That poor girl!"</p>

<p>The fellow took a step backward as though about
to "rush" his opponent. Rapidly his eyes took in
everything around him. One hand felt for his revolver.
But Monsalvat's self-possession held the
rowdy in check. Perplexed, and already beaten, he
began to feel ridiculous. This man was not trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
to provoke him; neither did he fear him. He saw
that the crowd and his companions had not noticed
his compromising move; and he decided he could
calm down without loss of prestige. Two or three
minutes passed. Monsalvat waited as though entrenched
in silence and calm. Something emanated
from him which quite disconcerted his enemy. The
latter lay aside his swaggering and said with a
forced sarcastic laugh:</p>

<p>"You know, I am afraid of you! That is why
I don't touch you. You are a regular man-eater,
you see,&mdash;and that makes me spare my friends!
I don't want to see them beaten up!..."</p>

<p>He stopped short, for his sarcasm quite obviously
fell flat, even in his own estimation. He approached
Monsalvat, and putting a hand on his shoulder said:</p>

<p>"See here, Monsalvat, it's lucky for you that it
was I you ran across here ... however ... well
... never mind all that.... I'm going to make
you see you're wrong. I'm going to let you talk
with her. You can ask her any questions you see
fit."</p>

<p>He went up to the girl and brought her back to
introduce her. Ashen-pale, embarrassed, she smiled
an absurd little smile, probably to hide her fear of
some fatal outcome to the scene. Her eyes tremulously
nestled for a moment in Monsalvat's steady
gaze; but the voice of her master drove them from
that refuge.</p>

<p>"This gentleman," he guffawed, "thinks I'm a
blackguard more or less! Well, I want you to tell
him whether you are satisfied with what I do for
you or not. Tell him the truth, don't be afraid!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsalvat, charmed and saddened, was still looking
at Nacha, though he scarcely saw her. His eyes,
softened with a pity intense enough to be pain, were
remodelling a truer image of this girl of the underworld.
She did not dare look at him. Her eyes
were raised to her "man." Her mute question did
not, apparently, interest Monsalvat, perhaps because
he knew what the answer would be.</p>

<p>"Answer! Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>Her voice was scarcely audible.</p>

<p>"And you have an easy time of it! You have
a home, haven't you?"</p>

<p>Nacha saw what she must do. She must speak,
declare herself satisfied with her lot. To do anything
else would be to draw down on herself this
man's anger at her champion. So suddenly she
began to talk in a torrent of rambling, half-coherent
words.</p>

<p>"Yes. I am satisfied. Why not? I have a home.
I'm lucky all right. I don't have to chase around
here and there the way I did before. And my home
is fine. I have all the money I want to spend, and
two servants. What more could I ask? And after
all I went through before, it's quiet, and safe!
You don't know what I went through!"</p>

<p>And, once started, she went on endlessly. She
seemed to be talking into space, not addressing anyone
in particular, and as if for herself alone, as if
to distract her own attention with her own words.
All that was not for Monsalvat's ears! She would
have preferred that Monsalvat should not hear her
at all! The words came out, poured out, beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the control of will, much like a somnambulist's
chatter. Monsalvat was not listening. It was
enough for him to look at her and be conscious of
her presence. Her gentleness, the tremulousness
of her words, the sadness of her eyes, were what
absorbed his whole interest. What she was saying
did not matter. The tango throbbing through the
air made him the more aware of the despairing
monotone of her voice. The mandola with its bitter
wail made her tragic melancholy only the more
poignant.</p>

<p>Even Nacha's owner seemed for a moment to
yield to the strange spell of these combining sounds.
Then he interrupted:</p>

<p>"Well! You see? Are you convinced? Didn't
I say she was putting on?"</p>

<p>Throwing back his shoulders, he burst into a
laugh that rang with contempt. The tango was
over, so was its spell.</p>

<p>The bully became the bully again. He approached
his sweetheart, pushed her toward his
comrades, who were sitting at their table waiting
to see how it would all end.</p>

<p>"Now get out of here!" he said, turning to Monsalvat;
"but before you go, I'll tell you who I am.
It's to your interest, friend&mdash;just a moment&mdash;we
might meet again&mdash;take a look at me!"</p>

<p>He was serious now. His right hand slipped
through the opening of his tuxedo and rested on his
belt. Then he announced solemnly:</p>

<p>"I am Dalmacio Arnedo, 'Pampa Arnedo,' as
they call me."</p>

<p>Monsalvat started. Instinctively he raised a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
hand, but immediately let it fall. The five of the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patota</i> made a rush for him. At the same moment
someone shouted: "The police!"</p>

<p>The cabaret seethed in confusion. Then suddenly
an anxious calm fell on the room, a forced
appearance of peaceableness, prearranged for the
dull eyes of authority.</p>

<p>From the first there had been among the onlookers
a certain number who took sides with Monsalvat.
His manner toward the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patota</i> won him
sympathizers. Some of them felt that the man had
the strength to support his assurance. The girl
herself aroused pity even though no one had had
the courage to speak up in her defence. Two or
three of these most sympathetic, or most prudent,
individuals had called for the police, to have help
on hand in case of an outbreak from the rowdies.</p>

<p>As the alarm was given the members of the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patota</i> hurried back to their places. Monsalvat,
facing Arnedo, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You rotter!"</p>

<p>Pampa Arnedo, safely seated at his table, answered
with a sinister smile, while his friends beside
him made noises with their lips, grimaced, and
began offering toasts, simulating exaggerated merriment.
Nacha looked pityingly at her protector.
Who was this man? What did he want of her?</p>

<p>The police after a rapid glance around the room
decided that "law and order" were still quite intact,
and with solemn prudence went out again. Monsalvat
returned to his table and paid his reckoning.
The Duck began to sing the well-known tune from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
a popular variety show: "He's going now, he's going
now!..."</p>

<p>The other members of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patota</i>, and even some
neutrals, joined in the chorus, "Now, now, he's
going now!" Monsalvat, as he got up, saw that
the girl, too, was singing and laughing. He paused
a moment, reproachfully it seemed, his eyes dimmed
with tears. Then quietly, without haste, he left the
cabaret, while the fellow who had burlesqued Nacha's
weeping broke out again with his "Oh, oh,
oh!"</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>Monsalvat had come to a crossroad in
his life. For nearly forty years he had
gone straight ahead, never hesitating as to which
turning to take. But now, as though a complete
transformation had occurred within him, he seemed
a stranger to himself, and he did not know where
this stranger was going.</p>

<p>Heretofore he had lived without criticizing the
world of which he was a part&mdash;which means that
he had been fairly happy. But during the past few
months he had come to view life and himself from
a critical point of view, and he had reached the
conclusion that as human beings go, he was one of
the unfortunates.</p>

<p>He and his sister Eugenia were illegitimate children.
His father, of the aristocracy, and rich with
many millions, had, some five years before, died
suddenly without leaving a will. Fernando was
intelligent and had something of his father's manner
and bearing; and as the legitimate heirs of the
Monsalvat fortune were all girls, Fernando was
given a good education while his father was still
alive. In order to keep him away from his mother,
an ignorant, irresponsible woman of the immigrant
class, the boy was sent to a boarding school. It was
only during vacations that he saw her. Fernando
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
remembered his father's visits, the discussions with
his mother, the admonitions he himself always received.
Once his father had taken the boy to one
of his ranches near Buenos Aires, a piece of property
as big as an entire state, on which were marvelous
forests, a house as magnificent as a palace,
and paddocks full of splendid bulls and woolly
sheep. More clearly than anything else, he remembered
how his father took him along almost stealthily,
and replied evasively when a friend, on the train,
asked who the child with him was. Later, at boarding
school, some boys who knew his father's legitimate
family, enlightened him as to his own birth.</p>

<p>When he left college he took up law. He was an
excellent student; and even before any regular admission
to the bar, he was filling a place in the office
of a well-known lawyer. Later he became this
man's partner, made money, and won recognition.
For a scruple he left the law office and went to
Europe, remaining there two years. When he returned
he was thirty-two. No longer wishing to
continue in his profession, he finally obtained a consulship
to an Italian city. It was now six months
since he had returned, after seven years' absence,
to settle permanently in his own country.</p>

<p>Fernando's mother was still living. She was ill,
and aged; indeed, although not yet seventy, she
seemed quite decrepit. Her son saw little of her.
She lived with a mulatto servant in a rather poor
neighborhood, in an apartment house facing Lezama
Park. Of his own sister he had seen little.</p>

<p>Monsalvat had lived as do most decent men of
his social position. He had worked hard in his law
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
office, and as consul had rendered services of distinction.
From boyhood, books had been his chief
companions. He had taken up sociology, and from
time to time he got an article published. His opinions
were respected and discussed in certain intellectual
circles. Though not socially inclined, and in
spite of his timidity and lack of confidence, he frequented
the clubs and theatres and race courses of
Buenos Aires. He was not often present at more
private social affairs, for the circumstances of his
birth prevented his receiving invitations from certain
quarters. While a student he lived on an allowance
from his father. Now, on his return from
Europe, he found himself possessed of no other
income than three hundred <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> monthly from a
piece of property which his father had given him
upon his passing his law examinations.</p>

<p>The knowledge of his illegitimacy had exercised
an incalculable influence on his character and general
outlook on life. When he was a student certain
youths of good family had made it plain that
they did not desire his friendship; and later he had
been socially snubbed on several occasions. He was,
however, inclined to exaggerate the number of these
slights. If an acquaintance failed to notice him, as
he passed along the street, he believed the omission
an intentional offense. If, at a dance, a girl chanced
to refuse his proffered arm, he was beset always with
the same thought.... "She does not dare to be
seen with me.... She knows!..." If he received
in his examinations a lower mark than the
one he thought he must have earned, he did not for
a moment doubt that it was the stigma of his birth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
which was to blame. Not a day passed that he did
not at some moment revert to this preoccupation.
He bore society no grudge; on the contrary, it
seemed to him quite natural that, dominant ideas
being what they are, he should be thought less of.
Nevertheless he felt humiliated, with a vague consciousness
that his value as a social being was diminished
by a misfortune beyond his control.</p>

<p>All this, of course, tended to isolate him, and
confirmed his tendencies toward bookishness. He
had no real friends. He felt himself to be quite
alone in life&mdash;alone spiritually, that is; for social
relations in abundance could not fail a man of his
intellect and professional position, whose character,
moreover, was above reproach, and who, in spite of
an outward coldness and an almost savage shyness
that frequently took possession of him, was a kind
and likeable sort of fellow.</p>

<p>This sense of solitude was tempered, if at all, by
one or two experiences in love. His dealings with
women were not those current among the young men
of his generation. Gossip attributed, nevertheless,
sentimental affairs to him, some of them with women
of prominence in the life of the Capital. For Monsalvat,
as his acquaintances noted, knew how to
please. There was something that appealed to
women in the soft inflections of his voice, and in
the deep seriousness of his eyes. But the secret of
his successes probably lay in the fact that he awakened
in women that compassion which is so ruinous
to them&mdash;so much so that Monsalvat was quite as
often the pursued as the pursuer. Two or three
times he had thought himself in love&mdash;mistakenly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
as he soon discovered; and women for their part
had loved him, and with passion. But these affairs
were, after all, nothing but passing gratifications of
the instinct of playfulness&mdash;little love episodes at
best.</p>

<p>In other respects his life might have been considered
a model and an exception. He was courteous
and simple in manner, with no violent dislikes
for anyone. Kind, always ready to do a good turn,
he pushed considerateness even to extremes. He
lived scrupulously within his means. He never paid
court to those in whose power it was to further his
advancement. He never indulged in petty disloyalties
toward his friends nor paid off injury with injury.
His relations with people were always sincere
and free from intrigue. A useful and an honest fellow
Fernando Monsalvat might have been considered
by anyone. Yet, these several months past, he
had been coming to the conclusion that he had lived
in a useless sort of way, that his life had been selfish,
mediocre, barren of any good. He was most of all
ashamed of his articles on moral and social subjects,
all of them colored with "class" prejudice,
mere reflections of the conventional, insincere, and
rankly individualistic standards which pervaded the
University, and which never failed of approval from
climbing politicians as well as from the cultured <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i>.
Monsalvat despised himself for having lived and
thought like any other man of his social group.
What real good had he ever accomplished? He
had lived for himself alone; worked for the money
that work might bring him; written to gratify an
instinct of vanity, a desire for prominence, for applause.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Now he endured a hidden torment: he was
disgusted with himself, with society, and even with
life, repenting, in his soul's secret, of so many wasted
years.</p>

<p>To generous spirits, such moral crises are natural;
moments are sure to come when they must view
their own conduct critically; and at such junctures
they loathe their sterile past. But how many ever
succeed in changing the direction of their lives?
Most of us stifle this moral unrest in the depths of
our consciousness; discontented and pessimistic, we
go on living a life we hate, tempering the noble impulses
that beset our guilty consciences with considerations
of personal, even petty, interests that bid
us take things as we find them. This latter was the
case with Monsalvat.</p>

<p>Two trifling events of his days in Paris had cast
a gloom over his outlook on life.</p>

<p>Convinced that he ought to put an end to his
solitude, he decided to marry; and he paid court to
a girl of good family with whom he had been on
pleasantly cordial terms in Rome. But no sooner
did the family and the girl herself become aware
of Monsalvat's intentions, than all friendliness on
their part vanished. An officious friend intimated
to Monsalvat&mdash;he never knew whether at the girl's
own request, or that of her parents&mdash;that his attentions
were not desired.</p>

<p>Later, at the hotel where he was stopping, he
made the acquaintance of another fellow countrywoman.
Friendship and flirtation followed. Monsalvat
became interested to the point of believing
himself in love. He made an offer of marriage and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
was contemptuously rejected, as though such an idea
on his part were in itself an insult. In situations of
this kind Monsalvat did not suffer so much on his
own account; it was not shame of being what he
was that hurt him, but a deepening sense of the injustice
inherent in people and in things.</p>

<p>He had given barely a thought to the imperfection,
the inequalities, of the world he was living in.
Full of his own thoughts, his own books, his own
pleasures, he had paid no attention to the cry of
anguish rising from the depths of the social order&mdash;as
an established, an immutable order he had
accepted it all along.</p>

<p>The fact that not till he had felt them himself
had he opened his eyes to the flagrant injustices of
society aroused a deep self-reproach in Monsalvat.
It seemed to him that at the bottom of his new
opinions purely selfish motives lay. On the other
hand, it was to the universal, the human aspects of
his own case that he gave his attention. Besides,
does not selfishness play a little part in our striving
toward the greatest ends?</p>

<p>It was some six months before the scenes in the
cabaret, that Fernando Monsalvat, disheartened and
disillusioned, had arrived in Buenos Aires. At first
it startled him to find himself judging people and
institutions so mercilessly. Why did he see everything
in its darkest colors? Had he become an incorrigible
cynic? Eventually he came to understand
that the severe judgments he was formulating were
the natural consequence of the critical spirit now
aroused within him. In the complex motivation of
the finest, noblest, most heroic gestures of men, how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
many small, unconfessable impulses always have
their play?</p>

<p>One afternoon chance revealed to him in vivid
colors the degree to which his life had been self-centered.
The taxi in which he happened to be
riding came to a standstill at a turning in Lavalle
Square. A crowd was coming toward him, singing.
It was a Sunday afternoon. He noticed that all the
doors of the neighborhood were closed. The singing
came nearer, swelling up from the street, rising
above the tree tops. It was an irritated, exasperated,
tumultuous mob which was approaching; and a song
which both alarmed and attracted him was resounding
from hundreds of mouths, its spirit typified in
the red flag waving above the multitude. He got
out of the taxi, and at that moment a bugle sounded.
The mob fell in on itself like a punctured balloon.
There was a volley of rifle shots, and in the confusion
he could see the police charging blindly with
their swords. The song continued, however, for a
time; then the regimented violence of the Law was
stronger than the impulsive violence of the <em>Internationale</em>.
The rabble broke into the side streets and
dispersed. The swords of the police eagerly sought
out the wretches crouching for shelter in the doorways.
Other wretches were in headlong flight, their
eyes wide with terror. No one was paying any
attention to the dead or wounded. Doors and windows
remained closed and silent. To Monsalvat,
sick with indignation, his soul flaming in outrage,
this very silence seemed a horrible complicity in a
crime.</p>

<p>His transformation, however, was purely an inner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
one. To be sure, he had somewhat changed
his manner of living: he no longer went to his club
nor to parties; he avoided most of his former
friends. But, after all, what had he actually done
these six months past? Had he perchance even discovered
the road he really wanted to take? He
was ceaselessly tormented by these questions, which
plunged him for hours at a time into inconclusive
meditations.</p>

<p>On one point he was resolved: he would not resume
his practice of law. What need had he to
earn money? To save it up? To spend it on
amusements? At any rate, he might give it away.
But to whom, and how? A friend, a successful
lawyer, who had a high opinion of Monsalvat's judicial
learning, proposed making him a partner in
his firm; but Monsalvat did not accept the offer.
He thought, finally, he would prefer a clerkship in
the Department of Foreign Relations, where his
seven years as consul would count, and where, too,
he was already looked upon with great favor. The
Minister had promised him a post and the appointment
would be coming along almost any day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he roamed the streets, gloomy and
preoccupied, fleeing from his acquaintances and the
Centennial festivities of the fashionable quarters to
wander through the tenement districts and the slums.
Sometimes he would join the spectators of some
street entertainment; and as he listened to the talk
of those about him, or spoke to them, men and
women, it surprised him to feel suddenly so much
at home with these poor people, so at one with them;
till he remembered that through his mother&mdash;born
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of laborers who had worked their way up to the
shopkeeping class&mdash;he, too, was <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pueblo</i>, very much
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pueblo</i>, a true child of the proletariat.</p>

<p>One day he went to see the building&mdash;a small
tenement&mdash;on the income from which he was living.
The house was a loathsome plague-spot in which
some fifteen wretched families lodged. How was it
that it had never before occurred to him to look this
house up, he wondered, disgusted with himself. And
why had his agent never reported such conditions?
Then he remembered that he had visited the property
in person several times before his second trip
to Europe; save that then all this poverty and squalor
seemed to him a natural, even an excellent,
thing! Was it not just this sort of surroundings
which pricked the ambition of these laboring people,
spurred them to work their way up to the comfort
they had learned through hard experience to appreciate?
Was not this very misery the first rung on
the ladder of progress in this blessed country of
opportunity, where "no one need be poor unless he
chooses to be"? Monsalvat thought with shame of
his earlier adherence to "economic liberalism," a
toothless theory, surely invented by the rich that
they might continue to exploit the poor! How much
he would have given now never to have written those
fine articles of his! He went away resolved to mortgage
the tenement, and put the money into improvements
which would make the building sanitary at
least.</p>

<p>The people of his old world, his men friends especially,
made fun of his new views. He had not
been talking much of his recent mental struggles;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
but his aloofness, coupled with a few articles of his
giving voice to the protest within him, annoyed not
a few of the distinguished persons who had been
wont to applaud him. Something had gone wrong
inside this man; and society commented on the
change without forbearance. Some said he was
crazy, others thought there was something off with
his liver or his spleen. More than one of his old
admirers looked at him with a kind of fear. What
was he going to do next? Perhaps break with all
established institutions.</p>

<p>Monsalvat, however, was nobody's enemy. Feelings
of revolt could not live long in his heart, but
became transformed, soon after birth, into a nameless
anguish, a physical and moral uneasiness. He
hated only himself. His rebellion was a rebellion
only against his own selfish years.</p>

<p>What was it he wanted now? What was he looking
for? What road was he going to choose? He
did not know. Around him he felt a great emptiness
that was ever growing greater. Wherever he
went a sense of infinite loneliness accompanied him.
He spent hours pondering the future. Meanwhile
he had grown strangely sensitive emotionally; and
it seemed as though the moment had come when his
outward life, as well, must undergo its transformation.</p>

<p>One night idle curiosity led him to a cabaret. He
knew little of this form of diversion. The "show"
entertained him; the tangos and the orchestra stirred
his emotions. This place of amusement seemed to
be a note of color in the bleak immensity of Buenos
Aires. On the other hand, he felt more alone than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
ever before. In all that dancing, in all that music,
he found, he scarcely knew why, the same sadness
which was in his soul. At times when the mandola
wailed in a crescendo from the depth of some vulgar
popular tune&mdash;fraught with all the coarseness and
abjections of the tenements of the city&mdash;he seemed
to hear in it a cry of loneliness, despair, and bitterness
rising from the dregs of life itself.</p>

<p>It was on that night that his eyes first met Nacha's.
They looked at one another with surprise,
and with a shade of embarrassment, as though they
knew one another. The girl lost her composure,
lowered her eyes, twisted her fingers nervously. For
two hours Monsalvat lingered in the cabaret, persisting
in this flirtation. He did not understand why
he had never liked loose women; indeed, it all
seemed to him rather absurd&mdash;though the girl did
have pretty eyes! Perhaps she was not what she
seemed! Perhaps she might some day love him,
chance permitting. Perhaps his loneliness would be
more bearable if a woman like her were there to
sympathize with him. When she left the cabaret,
he followed in a taxi. With her companion, she
went into a house. Monsalvat concluded that she
lived there. He got out of the taxi, and loitered
about in the middle of the dark street. She came
out on the balcony for a moment, casting two or
three rapid glances in his direction.</p>

<p>A few nights later Monsalvat returned to the
cabaret. He did not find her there. His loneliness
again became unbearably acute, and his restlessness
intolerable. It seemed to him more than ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
imperative that he find some purpose in life again,
some clear comprehension of his mission and destiny.</p>

<p>A few days later the scene in the cabaret occurred.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>It was one o'clock when Monsalvat came out of
the cabaret. As he stepped out on the sidewalk
the cold, waiting thief like at the door, leapt at his
throat and face. He turned up the collar of his
overcoat and walked slowly away, careless of direction,
his eyes following the sidewalk in front of him
as a wheel follows a groove.</p>

<p>At the first street corner he paused. People were
leaving theatres and cafés, whirling away into the
dark in taxis and automobiles. The trams were
crowded. The cross-streets, of unpretentious apartment
houses and second-rate shops, all darkened and
asleep, were poorly lighted; but at its southern end,
the center of the capital's night life dusted the sky
with a golden sheen. Monsalvat turned in that
direction, walking on mechanically till he came out
on the brilliantly illuminated avenue. Through the
immense plate glass windows of the cafés he could
see the multitudes of little tables, and topping them,
hundreds of human torsos gesticulating under thick
waves of cigarette smoke, pierced with colored
lights; while through the opening and closing doors,
tango music broke in irregular surges, now strong,
now weak. The street corners were sprinkled with
men stragglers or survivors from larger groups of
joy-seekers. Automobile horns, conversations in
every tongue, the bells of blocked street-cars, rent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the lurid glow with resounding, impatient clangor.
But in spite of all the animation and illumination of
the theatre district, the merry-making had not the
enthusiasm of the earlier hours. Only that irreducible
minimum of vitality remained, that residue of
joy-thirst, which survives evenings of revelry, clinging
tenaciously to the later hours, and scattering
over the after-midnight streets a pervading sense of
weariness.</p>

<p>Indifferent to the animation of these glittering
thoroughfares, concentrated on his own inner misery,
bewildered in the maze of conflicting emotions
within him, Monsalvat went on his way, but walking
more and more slowly now. He tried to analyze
the thoughts and sensations that were tormenting
him; but the effort served only to exasperate his
distress. He had never suffered like this. All he
knew for the moment was that his heart, with an
impulsiveness which he felt certain was quite disinterested,
had gone out to a girl he saw doomed, the
victim of her own will to live and of the evil nature
of others. How cowardly, futile, he had felt himself
in the presence of her helplessness and humiliation!
And then something overwhelming, imperious, had
seemed to stir in his being, filling him with a courage
strangely unfamiliar to him, lifting him from
his chair, and throwing him forward against the
girl's tormentors. But had he not played the simple
fool&mdash;in public? Had not even Nacha joined in
the mockery as he left the room, proving incapable
of loyalty even toward the man who had defended
her? Then that final thrust of the bully: "Take a
good look at me! I am Dalmacio Arnedo! Pampa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Arnedo!" In the days of his thoughtless prosperity
as a student and man of promise, Fernando had
thought little of the sister, Eugenia Monsalvat, who
shared his own position in his father's family. A
touch of shame and sorrow had come to him when
he learned that she had left her&mdash;and his&mdash;mother's
home&mdash;disappearing from even that penumbra of
respectability, to live as the mistress of a man named
Arnedo. So this was the man, thus crossing his path
a second time, rising before him leering and insulting,
and pronouncing his own name as a symbol of
redoubled scorn for the name of Monsalvat! And
that sister, again! Had he done anything to prevent
her fall, in the first place, or to redeem her,
now that she had fallen?</p>

<p>He was still walking slowly down the avenue of
white lights when he felt a touch on his arm. It
was Hamilcar Torres, one of the most intimate of
his few intimate acquaintances.</p>

<p>"Give me a few moments, Monsalvat. Let's go
in here, shall we?"</p>

<p>They entered one of the large cafés. The orchestra
here, composed of girls, was playing a languid
gypsy waltz, the music and the musicians, in
combination, evoking expressions of melting languor
on the faces of the males who were assembled there,
most of them, at this advanced hour, gazing about
in stupid rapture over wine glasses that were being
filled and filled again.</p>

<p>"It was I who sent for the police," said Torres,
when they had taken a table. He brought out the
words very deliberately, marking the syllables, and
in a tone calculated to emphasize the allusion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
though his manner at once changed from a mood
of reproving seriousness to one of amusement, and
bantering knowingness.</p>

<p>Torres was a physician; his strikingly white teeth,
crisp curly hair, eyebrows prominent over deep-set
black eyes, suggested a trace of African blood in
his veins. Under a thick black mustache, rather
handsomely set against rosy, smooth-shaven cheeks,
he smiled continuously, sometimes sadly, sometimes
ironically, sometimes with affected malevolence and
shrewdness.</p>

<p>Monsalvat did not reply. The doctor, turning
sideways to the table, crossed his long legs, and,
thrusting them far beyond the limits of the space
which might reasonably be allowed to each patron
of the café, obstructed all passage near him.</p>

<p>"I followed along after you," he said, shifting uneasily
on his chair and turning his head so as to face
Monsalvat, "because I wanted to put you on your
guard. You've got to be careful with these people,
old man! I know them&mdash;they won't stop at anything&mdash;and
I saw that you ... and the girl ...
well ... er ... eh?"</p>

<p>His right finger pointed, on the query, to his own
right eye, then he waggled it at Monsalvat. Again
his face varied from a rather exaggerated severity
to a knowing smile; and turning his head so that it
was once more in line with his body, and he had
to look sideways at Monsalvat, he added:</p>

<p>"No need to deny it, my boy! After all, the
girl is pretty enough! But&mdash;be careful.... When
women like that get a hold of a fellow...!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you putting it rather strongly, Torres?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
I have a feeling that this particular girl is not of
just the kind that...."</p>

<p>"Just the kind that what?" snapped the doctor,
still eyeing Fernando sidewise, and with a mocking
smile. "You don't know her!"</p>

<p>Then facing Monsalvat, and mustering a choleric
frown for the occasion, he added impressively in a
mysterious and earnest tone of voice, as if revealing
something from a transcendental source:</p>

<p>"More than one man has gone to the dogs on
that girl's account!"</p>

<p>Whereupon, with an air of philosophical indifference,
he settled back to his former comfortable
position.</p>

<p>Monsalvat was not convinced. Nacha's gentle
eyes seemed to refute the miserable innuendos Torres
was making. And yet, supposing it were all
true? What then? A wave of passionate curiosity
swept over Monsalvat. He wanted to know more.
He must know more! Yet he said nothing. He
could not bring out the question that was hanging
on his lips. Torres divined what his friend was
thinking, and pleased to be able to show how intimately
he knew the ins and outs of life in Buenos
Aires, he began:</p>

<p>"This Arnedo fellow&mdash;Pampa, as they call him&mdash;is
real low-life, the kind who wouldn't hesitate to
put a bullet through your body, or forge your name.
Two or three times he has come near going to jail.
And you saw how he treats the girl! An out and
out bully!"</p>

<p>"What's her name? Who is she?" interrupted
Monsalvat, with ill-concealed eagerness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's known as Lila about town; but her real
name is Ignacia Regules&mdash;Nacha, as most people
call her for short. Her mother kept a student's
boarding house&mdash;still does, for that matter. I knew
her mother ... because once...."</p>

<p>"Keep to Nacha, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I see; you want to hear all about the girl!
That's the important subject!" The doctor looked
slyly at Monsalvat, enjoying the latter's confusion
at this sudden self-betrayal. "I'll tell you something
of what I know&mdash;not all, of course. I'm
obliged to keep the most interesting parts to myself.
Well, this Nacha, while still living in her mother's
boarding house, fell in love with a student and ran
away with him. He kept her a couple of years or
so; then he left her, and at a very critical juncture&mdash;she
was in the hospital, with a child that, fortunately,
did not live. When she came out she took
a job in a store. Probably she was willing enough
to live a decent life, but the bad example of some
of her girl friends was too much for her. She
began to earn ten times more than what she got in
the store&mdash;in a different way."</p>

<p>Torres winked as he now looked at Monsalvat.</p>

<p>"And how do you know all this?" the latter inquired.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, that is something I don't
tell."</p>

<p>The doctor did not wish to modify the effect of
his story by simply stating that Nacha had known
a friend of his, and once, when she was ill and
Torres had been attending her, she had given him
her whole story. Torres enjoyed mystification for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
its own sake, and preferred, just for the fun of it,
to keep Monsalvat on edge a little longer.</p>

<p>And this game, for that matter, was working well.
In utter distress, Monsalvat stared fixedly, now at
his friend, now at the orchestra, now at the unknown
faces about the great hall. But he did not
see what was before his eyes. His mind was filled
with the image of his own sister, abandoned to misfortune,
perhaps now a common woman of the
streets; of his mother weeping her life out over her
own and her daughter's shame; of Nacha Regules,
caught in the brutal clutches of Pampa Arnedo; and
finally of his own past self, happy, free to travel,
flirting with handsome women, courting literary
fame, lounging at his club, or attending fashionable
parties! While he had been idling thoughtlessly
along in this relative but still gilded luxury, Eugenia
Monsalvat was falling lower and lower in the social
scale! His sister! But not his sister, only! Millions
of women were enduring a misery like hers!
And a world of well-nourished, "successful" men
and women went gaily on its way, indifferent to the
ceaseless suffering of these other women, proud of
its money, and its easy virtue, robbing the poor of
sisters and daughters, buying them, corrupting them,
enjoying life.</p>

<p>"And then?" asked Monsalvat, noticing that Torres
was studying him, and eager to learn everything
he could about the life of this girl, who seemed to
him at that moment to represent all the unfortunate
women of the earth in her person.</p>

<p>"Well, she left the store&mdash;you would never guess
why! She wanted to be 'respectable'! She took up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
some kind of work, I forget what; but eventually
she drifted into a café, as a waitress. Can you
imagine 'respectable'&mdash;and a café waitress!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat, more and more irritated at his companion's
flippancy, suggested that these attempts of
Nacha to work and to be "respectable" were certainly
nothing against her. She might be a good
girl, after all!</p>

<p>"Good? Of course! These girls are all good&mdash;almost
all, at least. We do judge them harshly, I
realize. If they do wrong, it is without knowing
exactly that it is wrong. And some of them really
have a high moral code&mdash;for instance...."</p>

<p>Torres was not smiling now. Memories of the
numberless poor creatures he had known, memories
of extraordinary cases of generosity, and loyalty,
and even heroism, for the moment drove his superficial
cynicism from him.</p>

<p>Monsalvat was not interested however, obsessed
as he was by the image of Nacha, who seemed to be
appealing to him to rescue her. And rescue her he
would! He would save her from her present tragic
situation, from fearful hours awaiting her in the
future, and from the memory of frightful hours of
the past. An idea that he must see her, speak to her
again, somehow, somewhere, took possession of him.
But how? And where? And supposing he should
meet her again? What would he say to her? He
did not know; but his determination was not shaken
on that account. He would see her&mdash;and save her;
not for her own sake, nor because he was himself
an "unfortunate" in society; nor because she was
beautiful, and his eyes had dwelt upon her; but for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
love of his sister rather, for the sake of his own
real self!</p>

<p>"These poor girls are simply victims of conditions,
I suppose," continued Torres. "Nacha told me once
that wherever she went, in shops, or workrooms, or
business offices, the men were after her. And it's
true, isn't it? We men, even the best of us, are a
bad lot. I'd like to know how a girl who hasn't
enough to eat, and who lives in the worst sort of
surroundings, can resist temptation, especially when
it comes in the form of a good-looking fellow who
offers to take her out of the hell she is living in....
No, they are not to blame...."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the "Merry Widow" waltz floated
languidly through the thick air of the café like a
maze of shimmering diaphanous silk or impalpable
tulle. But to Monsalvat it seemed that this music
was winding itself about him, body and soul, a merciless
bandage which bound him tighter and tighter,
treacherously increasing the pain it promised to
soothe. The sadness dwelling at the core of all
worldly pleasures fell from each musical phrase,
each bar, each note, on the heavy air of the café.
Music in such places as this always distressed Monsalvat.
Tonight his whole being was an open wound,
over which the ceaselessly moving grind of the music
grated until he wondered that he did not scream
with pain. Was his own record absolutely clean?
Had he, too, not bought favors from women&mdash;be
it, indeed, with flattery and favors returned? And
where were those women now?</p>

<p>Had they, too, by selling themselves, lost all right
to the world's respect, the right to be treated as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
human beings, to be pitied? His fault? He despised
himself utterly. Only the violence of his
self-reproach gave him the strength to bear his
pain.</p>

<p>"And then what?" he queried, rousing himself
from his abstraction.</p>

<p>Torres, who had been silent for a time, now answered
the question that came almost mechanically
from Monsalvat's lips, and told all he knew of
Nacha's history. Outstanding in her checkered
career had been her love affair with the young poet,
Carlos Riga. Together they had endured the most
frightful poverty in the Argentine bohemia. Nacha
had left him finally, driven away by sheer hunger&mdash;and
the thought that perhaps her being always with
him was an unjust burden on her penniless lover.
In these circumstances she'd concluded that it was
no use trying to be a "decent" girl; and she had
gone off "on her own," taking up with a man&mdash;who
was soon followed by another&mdash;better able to support
her. One day the idea came into her head
that exclusive devotion to any one protector meant
a sort of unfaithfulness to Riga, whom she really
adored. From that moment she gave herself up to
the roving life of the cabarets and places of amusement.
It was during this time that she met Arnedo.
He found her pretty, intelligent, admired the ease
of manner she had acquired in her mother's boarding
house, was impressed by the smatterings of culture
she had absorbed from Riga and other young
writers she had known in Riga's company&mdash;in short,
decided that Nacha was the jewel he was looking
for&mdash;a girl he could "flash" on Capitol sportdom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and "show off" as his "woman" among people appreciative
of such display.</p>

<p>"A horrible story!" exclaimed Monsalvat, gloomily.
"Can there be many girls like that?"</p>

<p>"Thousands of them. And I really know something
about it.... I have long been a police physician.
My dissertation was on that very subject!"
And he lectured at length on the theme, sparing no
details of the traffic which has made Buenos Aires
famous as a market of human flesh.</p>

<p>Monsalvat could not speak meanwhile. He was
thinking of his sister, trying to picture to himself
what her lot must be. He saw her in the abandonment
that followed her disgrace, struggling not to
lose her grip on life, failing, struggling again to
evade the deeper degradations of the outcast she
saw below her; and finally sinking in the loathsome
mire, dragged into its depths, by a trader's claws,
perhaps, tortured, enslaved, and&mdash;who could say!&mdash;dead!
He listened with speechless intentness.
"What a ghastly nightmare this world is!" He
stammered at last:</p>

<p>"And what is being done to remedy all this?"</p>

<p>"What is there to do, my dear fellow? We
would have to destroy everything and construct
society anew!"</p>

<p>At these words Monsalvat seized his friend's arm
with violence; his eyes were moist with emotion and
his voice rang with a strange solemnity, as he said
slowly:</p>

<p>"Exactly! Exactly! Well, everything is being
destroyed, and a new society is coming into being!"</p>

<p>Torres assented, as far as his facial muscles were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
concerned, responding to the suggestiveness of Monsalvat's
moral earnestness, to the emotion which his
friend's vision of a great and approaching Good
stirred in his own sluggish depths. He even went
so far as to nod.... Then came reaction. His
inner, his real self recovered from the momentary
spell of Monsalvat's ingenuous and lyric optimism.
One look about at the café's noisy and drunken
hilarity, and the man of generous instincts disappeared,
giving place again to the man of the world,
the man like any other man, stamped with all the
ideas and sentiments of his kind. To Torres the
words Monsalvat had spoken, his Quixotic theories,
his grief over things that were not only irremediable
and accepted, but even sanctioned, and necessary,
began to appear ridiculous, and speaking as a doctor,
trained to seek the origin of all human abnormalities
in overstrung nerves and disturbed physical or mental
equilibrium, he replied lightly and skeptically as
before:</p>

<p>"The problem, you see, is too complex ... there
is no solution really...."</p>

<p>Monsalvat did not hear him. Another voice was
filling his ears, a voice from a thousand throats,
convicting him of his own responsibility, too, for the
world's crimes. His heart seemed to him a mournful,
hollow, and despairing bell; his eyes saw the
world as a scene ready set for tragedy&mdash;the tragedy,
first, of his mother, deceived, suffering all her life,
and handing on suffering to her children; then his
sister's; then Nacha's. In an eternal chorus of tears
rose the lamentations of the lost women of the
earth, the weeping of their parents, their brothers;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the cries of the children they were driven to destroy;
their own screams of shame, and clamorings
of hunger.</p>

<p>"Why, man, what's the matter with you?" asked
Torres finally. "Hadn't we better be going? It's
three o'clock."</p>

<p>Monsalvat nodded and got up. He took leave of
Torres at once, on the pretext he did not feel well,
and started off for the South End, toward the <em>Avenida
de Mayo</em>, where he lived.</p>

<p>He went to bed at once upon reaching his rooms.
But he could not sleep. He did not know why it
was; but the sound of the shots that had brought
down some of the human creatures in the mob at
Lavalle Square, and the song they had sung, became
interwoven with one of the cabaret tangos he had
just been hearing. This strange music haunted his
ears and drove sleep far from him. Later, when he
had fallen into a kind of half slumber, there came
towards him a procession of frightful figures, howling
and groaning louder and louder as they approached;
and he knew that this procession was
Humanity. It was already dawn when he began to
sleep&mdash;uneasily and for only a little while. But
even this semblance of slumber brought with it a
nightmare. A monstrous phantom, covered with
gold, silks, and precious stones, its jaws those of
an apocalyptic beast, its claws, too, dripping blood,
was there before him, in his room, although scarcely
contained by it. The monster approached his
bed, showing its fangs, about to devour him; and
this monster, with its charnel house of a belly, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
lay countless generations of the world's unfortunates,
was Injustice.</p>

<p>Monsalvat got up late. He was quiet now. At
last there was new life within him. Everything had
new life, new meaning. What this new life was he
could not have said. But he knew that within him
there was now a sense of clearness where before
there had been nothing but confusion and obscurity.</p>

<p>He breakfasted and went out, thinking, rather
vaguely, that he would go to his mother's. But, as
he walked on, he turned in another direction. Moving
absent-mindedly, yielding to a new sweet sense
of inner calm, he seemed not to notice the streets
along which he passed. When he came to himself,
he noted that he was within a few yards of Nacha's
house. Without hesitating, certain now that he was
doing the right thing, he went up the steps and rang
the bell.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>Nacha had not been able to sleep. Rarely,
even in her unhappy life, had she spent so
bad a night. On arriving home from the cabaret,
Arnedo had gone to bed in silence. This Indian-like
taciturnity of his always terrified her. Dread
of the man's violence, fear of being once more
abandoned, and forced to return to her former
precarious circumstances, mingled with the anxieties
the day had brought her. Carlos Riga, she had
only that morning learned, was dying in a hospital
ward. Yet curiously, what tortured her more than
grief for her former lover or fear for her own
life, was the uneasiness aroused within her by the
memory of how she had treated that unknown man
who had so chivalrously come to her defense in the
cabaret. He had been ready to risk his life for her,
and she had rewarded him with a laugh, a laugh
half of fear, half of distraction; but to him it must
have seemed one of treacherous mockery.</p>

<p>Into her heart that night a new, a strangely engrossing
uneasiness had come, a presentiment which
she could not have explained, but which she knew
she must conceal from Arnedo as though it were a
crime. It was a sense of impending evil, an accumulation
of forebodings&mdash;reminiscences that the
news of Riga's condition had brought up, memories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
of the evening itself; bits of her own past; pictures,
which her frightened imagination painted, of a terrible
future&mdash;a future with at best such poor, such
ill-nourished, such unsubstantial hopes&mdash;all blending
into a vague conviction that Fate had decreed some
great misfortune for her.</p>

<p>How she longed for the relief of slumber! She
would need to look fresh and happy when she faced
Arnedo the following day. This preoccupation
filled her insomnia with a sort of hectic frenzy.</p>

<p>To destroy all traces of the hours of torment she
was enduring, she imagined herself digging little
graves for them, and burying them one by one under
a dust of forgetfulness. Meanwhile, in her
desire for the dawn, she turned on the light every
few minutes to see what time it was. Four o'clock,
half-past four, five! Never had a night lasted so
long! She thought the clock must be slow, and got
up to see if there were any signs of coming day.
Darkness was still unbroken. Only a faint glow in
the depths of the sky seemed to presage the possibility
of morning. How she hungered for light in
that overwhelming darkness!</p>

<p>And meanwhile the image of the man in the
cabaret haunted her. He looked at her so strangely!
No one else had ever looked at her in just this
fashion. There was not in his eyes that desire
which she saw in the eyes of other men. It was
something else, something else! Especially from
the moment when all the café had turned on her!
Why had he gazed at her so persistently? A few
nights before, in this same cabaret, her eyes had
met those of this man. She had not been able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
keep from looking at him; she had not been able
to avoid his gaze when he looked her way. And
then he had followed her home&mdash;doubtless to find
out where she lived. She had seen him lingering
there in the street and had stepped out on the balcony
for a moment.... Who was he? Did he
want to take her from Arnedo, to have her for
himself? Why should he wish to defend her when
his doing so could only injure her? He was to
blame, in large measure, for Pampa's bad humor.
As for Pampa, she hated him; but she could not
leave him. He had broken her spirit. He could
insult her and knock her about; but instead of turning
against him, she would become more submissive
and obedient than before. Why? How strange
life was! She would never understand herself. At
times it seemed as though another being dwelt within,
forcing her to do things she could not otherwise
account for. Why else, for example, should she
have behaved so meanly, so contemptibly, towards
this man who had defended her; who, clearly, was
interested in her; who was, perhaps, in love with
her? Why? Why? That whole long night she
had tried not to think of this stranger; but to no
avail. There was something about the way he held
himself, something in his eyes, and in the words he
spoke, which set him apart from everyone else she
knew. And this distinction fascinated her. With
what spirit he had faced that hostile gang! Something
was drawing her towards him. It would
frighten her to meet him again&mdash;yet she longed for
just such an encounter. Why should she want to
see him? She did not know! She refused to know!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>Only the memory of the poet who had been her
lover softened the pain of that unending night. He
at least was good! He was loyal! He was compassionate!
His heart knew the most beautiful
words in the world with which to console; he had
developed her intelligence, taught her to bow her
head to irremediable injustice. Only this, perhaps,
had saved her from the hard, cynical desperation of
other women who had, like her, been overcome by
wrong. And now he was dying. He was perhaps
already dead. She had seen a report of his illness
in a newspaper the night before; and the shock of
it had left her helpless to disguise the sadness which
possessed her as she sat with the others in the
cabaret.</p>

<p>She felt responsible in a certain way for Riga's
death. Had she not abandoned him at the very
moment when he most needed her support? And
why had she behaved so? Why was there this incessant
contradiction in her life? She had run away
from home at the very time when she had become
most attached to her mother and her sister. She
had loved Riga passionately, and she had fled from
him. She felt sympathy and admiration for the man
in the cabaret, and she had mocked him. Why did
she always act in this unaccountable way? Then
Riga took entire possession of her thoughts, and
she lived over again the time that had elapsed between
their first meeting and her tragic abandonment
of him.</p>

<p>It was in her mother's boarding house that they
had begun their friendship. Later, after her misfortune,
she learned of the poet's difficulties. Surrounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
as she was by gross, vulgar people, she
thought of him as a noble and pure spirit. Years
later, when she was working as a waitress in a
café, she met him again. They saw one another
several times, compared their troubles, were touched
by each other's sufferings. So they went to live
together. This union lasted three years; and in the
midst of poverty, grief and despair, they came to
adore one another. They both worked hard; but
Destiny seemed bent on sucking their blood. As
their circumstances became poorer and poorer, Riga
took refuge in drink and stopped writing. She had
gone hungry, taking the bread from her own mouth
to feed him, to keep him alive. But a day came
when she had no more reserves of courage. She
had endured all she could. Life and youth cried
out for their rights; and she went away, exhausted
physically and morally, weeping out all the remaining
strength of her broken heart.</p>

<p>A little before seven o'clock, taking care not to
waken Arnedo, she got out of bed again, and tiptoed
to the door of the apartment, stepped out to the
elevator and rang the bell. When the car came
up she asked for the <em>Patria</em>, the newspaper to which
Arnedo subscribed. The postman had not yet delivered
the mail and Nacha sent the boy out to get
the paper. While waiting for him to come back
she walked restlessly back and forth, from the window
opening on the street, to the front door. It
was a dull, oppressive, cloudy morning; the sky had
a yellowish, dirty look. The air was very damp
and on the window-panes and outside woodwork
large drops of moisture hung. Nacha had a painful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
presentiment. Certainly such a day could bring
nothing good. Pale, trembling, she ran to the door
the moment she heard the elevator start again.</p>

<p>She snatched the paper eagerly from the boy's
hand, opened it and looked frantically at the inner
page. The item, alas, was there, the news which
pierced her heart, and seemed like a claw tearing
at her breast! Shrinking, scarcely able to stand
upright, she went to the sitting-room and, still
clutching the newspaper, threw herself on the sofa.
Now it seemed to her that her life was indeed all
spent. She lay there a long time, weeping. This
man, to whom the newspaper bade farewell with
words of affection, was Carlos Riga, the poet who
was all generosity, all goodness, the boy who had
been her lover and her friend in the best years of
her life! He was the inspired dreamer who had
freed her soul from the vulgar preoccupations of
her kind; he was the idealist who had shared illusions
and hopes with her; he was the man who had
never spoken to her a word that was not kind and
affectionate. No tears were enough for this loss.
What though she never saw him and could not see
him? She needed to know that he was alive, so as
not to be altogether bad, so as not to become utterly
unworthy. She wept. For death, in taking Riga
away, broke her last connection with the only happy
hours she had known in her life as slave and outcast.</p>

<p>She sat up on the sofa at last and read and re-read
the <em>Patria's</em> tribute to the dead poet. Then she
went to a closet and took from it Riga's "Poems,"
which she had bought before he became her
lover&mdash;later he had written in a dedication which filled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the first two blank pages. With tears in her eyes
she glanced over the well-known verses, but as
some of Pampa's snores echoed through the apartment,
she hastily kissed the volume, and put it back
in its hiding place, fearful lest Pampa should appear.
She must also conceal the traces of her
weeping lest Arnedo get up suddenly and see her
swollen face.</p>

<p>She returned to the sitting-room with the idea of
writing perhaps to her sister. She heard the cook
stirring about in the kitchen. A talk with the woman
might distract her. With affected cheeriness she
went out and ordered breakfast.</p>

<p>How afraid she was to linger in any place where
she might encounter Arnedo! But she knew that
he would demand an explanation of her gloom of
the night before, of her refusal to obey his orders
and dance. She went to the dining-room, in the
corner of the apartment farthest away from the
room where Pampa was sleeping. These devices
seemed to postpone for awhile the moment she
dreaded. What was Pampa going to say? He
might beat her! He might drive her out of the
house! What could she look forward to? Several
times she asked the maid whether <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">el Señor</i> was getting
up. In this way she learned when he was
awake, when he asked for his breakfast, when he
went to take his bath. Strange he should not be
asking for her. And this silence terrified her!
Finally, at noon, knowing that he must be nearly
dressed, she tried to prepare herself to face him;
but she was restless, anxious and nervous.</p>

<p>She heard his step approaching the dining-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
The door opened. Scarcely glancing at her, and
without a word of greeting, from the threshold
Pampa motioned to her to come to him.</p>

<p>As she went into the sitting-room, Nacha felt
Arnedo's piercing gaze upon her face. She did not
know where to turn her eyes. Back to a table, his
hands in his pockets, Pampa stood watching her
with a hard smile, apparently enjoying her distress.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at last, "I want to know what
was the matter with you last night?"</p>

<p>"Nothing! I was ill&mdash;I told you."</p>

<p>She sat down as she spoke. Pampa, paying no
attention to her answer, began to whistle a tango.
Half dead with fear, Nacha had scarcely been able
to articulate the words.</p>

<p>"Sick, eh?"</p>

<p>His hard eyes swept the girl sarcastically. A
long silence followed, broken only by the jangling
of some keys which Pampa was turning over and
over in one of his pockets. He pretended to smile;
then suddenly, exasperated, almost shouting, and
with an ugly word, he broke out,</p>

<p>"Sick! Do you think you can get away with that
excuse?"</p>

<p>Nacha, in terror, drew back towards the sofa,
her knees and hands unsteady. Stammering, half
crying, she begged him not to shout so. She had
not meant to offend him!</p>

<p>"I've good reason to shout," he continued. "I've
told you, haven't I, that I wouldn't stand your making
up to anybody! You wore that fool face of
yours last night because you think you're in love
with someone&mdash;for all I know with that mangy cur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
who butted in. Well, I'm not going to be made a
fool of, understand? I'm not going to support a
woman who goes around cry-babying and putting
on."</p>

<p>"I was sick, I tell you."</p>

<p>"And I tell you, you weren't! If you say that
again, I'll break every bone you've got in your
body!"</p>

<p>"Pampa! please, don't talk so loud!"</p>

<p>Arnedo began to pace up and down, a torrent
of vituperation and curses flowing from his lips,
his eyes glittering with savage cruelty. Nacha
thought for a moment of telling him the truth, that
her tears were due to her grief for the death of a
man she had loved; but she knew Arnedo would not
believe her. Besides, would not her feeling for a
man she had broken with, irritate Pampa for the
very reason that he could not understand such subtleties
of emotion? It seemed safest to be silent,
to endure his insults and his anger without replying.</p>

<p>At last, having worked off some of his temper,
Arnedo announced that he was going out, and would
not be back for lunch. Nacha followed him to the
door, submissive, and still frightened. She even
drew up to him as though expecting a caress; but
Arnedo brushed her aside contemptuously and
slammed the front door behind him.</p>

<p>Though Nacha could not restrain an access of
nervous weeping she felt, after all, a sort of relief.
The scene had "ended well" for her! Her thoughts
were free now to return to Riga. She would go
to the cemetery, and at least see where they were
burying him. And she would wear black, very simple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
black, so as not to attract attention! In those
moments at least she must appear worthy of the
humble poet who had loved her!</p>

<p>She had just finished dressing when the maid
announced a caller.</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"A gentleman. He will not give his name."</p>

<p>Nacha's heart began to beat more quickly, and
with an unaccountable expectancy.</p>

<p>"You know very well that I don't receive calls
from gentlemen.... Is he well dressed?"</p>

<p>The maid nodded.</p>

<p>"Tell him I am not at home. Just a moment&mdash;well&mdash;yes,
tell him I am not at home!"</p>

<p>The maid left the room, but returned almost
immediately.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't go, Ma'am," she reported, considerably
alarmed; "He walked right in.... He
looks all right, but...."</p>

<p>Nacha, with some uneasiness, went into the sitting-room.
To her amazement she found herself
face to face with the stranger of the cabaret.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>"Who are you?... What do you want?..." asked
Nacha after the first moment
of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Who am I? Nobody in particular! Just someone
who has guessed that you are unhappy, and is
anxious to help you."</p>

<p>"But ... you must have understood that I
didn't want to see you again! I can't receive you
here. You shouldn't have come to this house. It's
hard on me! Think of the consequences! Perhaps
I may lose my place here!"</p>

<p>"Your place here is what you hate more than
anything else in the world!"</p>

<p>"How do you know? I'm not so sure.... I
have a quiet home&mdash;and I'm free!"</p>

<p>The way the man looked at her made her break
off. They were both silent for a time, the stranger,
however, not taking his eyes from Nacha for a
moment. She could see that he wanted to speak,
but evidently did not dare. At last, in a low voice
and with visible emotion, he began:</p>

<p>"Nacha&mdash;you see I know your name&mdash;you are
not telling me the truth! You are not free!... You
are suffering; and last night I saw how much!
From the moment I first saw you I have felt a
tremendous pity for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, really?" Nacha exclaimed, with a laugh of
affected irony, calculated to put an end to the conversation
with this man who had forced his way
into her house, whose presence there was compromising
to her, and who now, into the bargain, was
allowing himself to express pity for her.</p>

<p>"Yes, real pity!" he repeated, evidently not
understanding that her laugh was aimed at him.</p>

<p>"How kind of you! You must be an unusual
sort of person!" Nacha said again, laughing scornfully.</p>

<p>"Your life is nothing but suffering," he continued,
rather as though he were talking to himself and had
not heard what Nacha said. "Here you live in
humiliation, worry, perpetual terror of what is
about to happen. That is not <em>living</em>, Nacha!"</p>

<p>"Call it dying if you like then. You are very
amusing. I am sorry you must go at once! But if
Pampa should find you here.... I wish he would
come!"</p>

<p>They stood facing each other there in the middle
of the room, the stranger listening quietly while
Nacha poured out her nervousness in words, and
yet more words, hurriedly, interrupting herself with
her own forced laughter, and distractedly moving
her hands and arms.</p>

<p>"Did you think you had made a hit with me?
How funny! But don't fool yourself! I can't help
laughing though, at the very idea! You're crazy.
Only crazy people act the way you do. Anyway,
I love Pampa. So there! You see what women
are. He treats me badly, he despises me, he beats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
me&mdash;but I wouldn't leave him for the first booby
who comes along!"</p>

<p>By way of reply he took her hand and led her to
the sofa, where obediently she sat down. In a low
voice that had in it the same ring of sincerity and
feeling as before, he went on:</p>

<p>"Nacha, you accept this man's ill treatment because
you are afraid of something worse. You
cannot bear to think that tomorrow, or whenever he
leaves you, you will have to go from one man to
another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is too much! Who gave you the right to
insult me? I am a decent woman!"</p>

<p>And then, finding her own words ridiculous perhaps,
she began to laugh; and the laugh, this time,
seemed to reveal her scorn for herself and her pride
withal in living as she was living. The man's compassion
grew.</p>

<p>"Why do you do it Nacha?"</p>

<p>"What?" she exclaimed, without checking her
laughter.</p>

<p>"You are trying to bring together things that
don't belong together. You are trying to make
yourself out a bad woman, while really you are
good."</p>

<p>Nacha, abruptly, became serious. She lowered
her eyes and for several seconds sat motionless,
looking at the floor, seemingly preoccupied. Finally
she raised her head, and slowly turned her gaze
upon this unknown friend. The peace she found in
his eyes astonished her. After a long silence she
asked him gently:</p>

<p>"Who are you? What is your name?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>He told her.</p>

<p>"Fernando Monsalvat...." she repeated, as
though trying to inscribe the syllables on her memory.
Then, apparently more at ease, she added
with a smile,</p>

<p>"Why did you come to this house? Not to do
me harm?"</p>

<p>"To do you good, little friend."</p>

<p>The girl smiled again, and again lowered her
eyes, only to raise them once more to Monsalvat's
face.</p>

<p>"Little friend&mdash;I like those words! Will you
really be my friend, really, in your heart? It does
me good to hear you speak to me that way. You
don't know what it means to me to be told I am
not bad. But, just the same, I am bad! Only I
do everything I can to make people think I am even
worse than I am."</p>

<p>She spoke in a yet lower tone as she went on,
somewhat ill at ease from the intimacy of her confession:</p>

<p>"We girls have to make a show of being what
we are not. It's easier that way for us to forget
our real selves: we seem to become somebody else.
I even go so far as not to blame the girl I was
yesterday for all that makes me the girl I am today."</p>

<p>She was silent awhile, apparently searching her
memory.</p>

<p>"Why do you try so hard to forget?" asked Monsalvat,
"Wouldn't it be better to remember&mdash;if the
present is so sad?"</p>

<p>"Sad? No, it isn't sad. Other people might
think so. But really it isn't. It is worse than that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
rather: it is empty, without any feeling at all. We
live in a sort of perpetual confusion. It's almost
like not knowing whether you're alive or not."</p>

<p>"But why not remember what is good in the past?
Why not dream?"</p>

<p>"Remember?" Her expression suggested that
a world full of past sufferings had taken possession
of her imagination.</p>

<p>"Why remember? Just to feel bad?"</p>

<p>"Yes, little friend, to feel, and to suffer. If you
didn't suffer, you would be horrible, all of you. It
is because you suffer that you deserve pity and sympathy;
and so you ought to seek out pain, and
treasure it."</p>

<p>Nacha raised her hands to her face. In his own
trouble, and in the compassion Nacha aroused in
him, Monsalvat began to feel a kind of satisfaction.
If she could still feel so deeply, there was hope.</p>

<p>"No, no!" she broke out suddenly. "We haven't
the right to suffer!"</p>

<p>"Human beings have no greater and more sacred
right."</p>

<p>"But don't you see that we girls must always be
gay, dance, laugh: our profession is joy, not suffering.
If we're glum, we lose our jobs. If we are
not ready for gaiety and caresses, we're accused of
not earning our pay."</p>

<p>Her lips smiled bitterly. Monsalvat, sitting with
one elbow on his knee, and his chin resting on his
hand, was looking at her as though trying to drink
in her very soul.</p>

<p>"We have to make ourselves over," Nacha continued,
"change our natures as well as our names.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Do you think it is only out of shame, or because of
our families, that we hide our identities? No, it
isn't wholly that. Taking another name makes us
seem different somehow. It's like the Carnival.
Under a disguise, you can do and say all the crazy
things that come into your head. Are you ashamed
afterwards? No, because when you take off your
mask you are no longer the person who played all
those wild pranks."</p>

<p>"And last night"&mdash;Monsalvat asked, after a brief
pause, "why were you so unhappy?"</p>

<p>Through his conversation with Torres he knew
the answer to this question; yet he listened anxiously
for her reply.</p>

<p>"There you see what comes of being out of sorts!"
she said at last. "Why should anyone go to a
cabaret to gloom and whimper like a simpleton?
Pampa had a right to be angry. I couldn't help it.
I had just learned that the only real friend I ever
had, the only man I ever really loved, was dying....
And you can imagine how I feel today. It's
lucky I can be alone.... I can afford to let myself
cry ... and remember!..."</p>

<p>Monsalvat had started at these words. He was
glad to know that Nacha was still capable of feeling.
At the same time, what she said about her love for
Riga filled him with a vague uneasiness. Interrupting,
he told her that he had known the poet.</p>

<p>"You knew him? Really? When? Where?"</p>

<p>From that moment Nacha looked upon Monsalvat
as a brother. The wave of feeling carrying
her towards him reached its height. She warmly
took his hand for a moment and asked him to talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
to her about Carlos Riga. There was tenderness
in her eyes now. The last vestiges of distrust had
vanished. She could have told him everything in
her life, shown him the very bottom of her soul.
He had known Riga! He need offer no other credentials
to claim her friendship!</p>

<p>They talked a long time of the poet, whom Monsalvat
had met through Edward Iturbide. The two
men had never become intimate friends; for Monsalvat
did not frequent the literary Bohemia that
had known Riga best. Nacha eagerly sang the
praises of her dead friend. Never had there lived
so fine a soul, so generous a heart, so kind a spirit!
Talking of him seemed to intoxicate her. She spoke
confusedly, and at times wildly, in a jerky monologue
of broken phrases. The moment came when
her eyes filled with tears and she shook with emotion.</p>

<p>"And to think that I, who am speaking to you
like this, I left him&mdash;the best man who ever
breathed! All because I was afraid of poverty,
afraid of hunger! It's true I've suffered, Monsalvat,
in the life I have been leading: no one can
know how much. But all I have been through was
nothing compared to the despair I felt when I deserted
Riga...."</p>

<p>The poor girl began to sob with great gasps that
shook her from head to foot. Monsalvat tried to
comfort her in words that astonished him, as he
uttered them, for their consoling intensity: never
had he heard nor spoken such words before. They
seemed to well up from the very depths of suffering
in which the girl before him was engulfed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"I remember so well the morning when I left
him," Nacha continued, "I shall remember it all
the days God lets me live. We had a poor little
room, dark, without air, the most miserable hole in
a horrible tenement; and we had no furniture&mdash;just
two wretched cots, old and broken and dirty. I
hadn't slept that night, for I was crying all the
time, going over my plans, and imagining how he
would feel when he found I had gone."</p>

<p>She stopped a moment to check a sob, and then
went on:</p>

<p>"At daybreak I dressed and made a little bundle
of the few rags I owned, and all quite calmly. I
wanted to put off the terrible moment as long as I
could. But at last it came. I was going to leave
him&mdash;and he loved me! It was so hard to do what
I had made up my mind I must do. I went to take
a last look at him. He was still asleep. I crept
up to him on tiptoe, and kissed him, on the forehead.
I don't know what happened then: I had to
lean against the wall, for it seemed as though the
whole world were falling away from me. My
heart must have stopped beating. I thought I was
dying and stayed there a long time, without moving,
just stupified. When I could move I sat down on
my cot and cried, then I got up to go. Every step
hurt. I went so slowly, it seemed as though years
must have passed&mdash;and at the door I looked back.&mdash;Why
was I leaving him? Why? Why?...
At last I crept out into the hall, and began to run,
to run like mad, down the stairs, and out into the
street...."</p>

<p>"You must tell me your whole life, from the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
when you left your mother's," said Monsalvat after
a pause.</p>

<p>Nacha hesitated, unwilling for a moment to comply.
At last she told him her first tragic adventure;
her love affair with one of the young men boarding
in her mother's house; his brutality towards her
when her timidity and shame placed her at his
mercy; his attempts to exploit her, and the illness
that followed. She recounted her attempts to support
herself, afterwards, by honest work, the usual
story of poverty, temptation and despair.</p>

<p>"There was no help for me. What could I do?
I struggled from week to week; but debts, hunger,
the need of clothes to put on my back, the luxury
I saw around me!... One day I told a girl who
worked in the store and was my friend that I would
do whatever she advised ... and she took me to
a house she knew...."</p>

<p>Nacha lowered her eyes, shame-faced.</p>

<p>"Did you live long in this fashion?" he asked
when she had lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>"Six months! Then one day I couldn't stand it
any longer: I left the store; and never went back
to that house. I did sewing, I made artificial flowers;
but ... I had no luck. I took any work that
came my way; but there were always back debts to
pay off ... and all the while every man who came
near me made love to me. More than once I left
my job in order to get away from them.... I
hated them, feared them, loathed them. At last,
after several years of this struggle, I got a job as
waitress in a café. There I was more annoyed by
men than ever; but I earned enough to be able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
afford a decent room and some furniture of my
own. And there I met Riga!"</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"After I left him? I went down again, this time
for good and all. It was then that Arnedo took
me."</p>

<p>They were silent for a space. Nacha did not
move. Wide-eyed, she sat staring straight in front
of her. What did she see? What were her
thoughts? Monsalvat, watching her with an intensity
that he had never before experienced, thought
the critical moment had come.</p>

<p>"Nacha," he said, "you must get out of all
this!"</p>

<p>Without looking at him, she slowly shook her
head.</p>

<p>"But your repentance...?"</p>

<p>"I do not repent." The words came out slowly
and deliberately, and she turned to look straight
at Monsalvat. "I did not intend any wrong. What
should I repent for?"</p>

<p>"But you are dissatisfied with the way you're
living?"</p>

<p>"God knows! I have suffered frightfully. How
could one help being sorry for such an unhappy
life?"</p>

<p>"Well then, why don't you make up your mind
to leave it?"</p>

<p>"I want to, but I can't. It's Fate! I was destined
to be a bad woman!"</p>

<p>All the energy of his spirit rushed to Monsalvat's
lips in words frantically shaped to arouse in Nacha
the decisive will to free herself from evil, to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
good at last. He seized both her hands. Feebly
she tried to pull away from him.</p>

<p>"Nacha, you must change your way of living.
You must be yourself! You must cease being someone
else! You must learn to live! To live, do you
hear? So as to be able to dream, to love&mdash;to remember!
Your soul wants to be free, and together
we are going to free it. This is slavery! You have
been speaking of what you have already suffered.
But that is nothing to the agonies that lie in wait
for you. Youth too will leave you; and the day
will come when you will be old, sick, worn out, a
human rag, falling lower and lower. At last you
will be, not only morally, but physically, a slave&mdash;The
trader who is even now awaiting you will get
you into his clutches. You will become a beast of
pleasure, locked up in a house of evil; and you will
have lost life, and hope&mdash;and love, too; for love
has little to do with the criminal instincts of the
men who will live on what you earn. You will be
sold like a thing, at auction. 'How much is this
woman worth? So much&mdash;take her! She is yours!'
And then you will fall so low that only the dens of
the underworld, only the gutters of the slums, will
be open to you; for you will be old, your beauty
eaten away.... Then finally you will die and no
one will know that you have gone. Then Nacha,
you, you whom I am speaking to now, will be tossed
into the potter's field like a dead dog."</p>

<p>She was in a paroxysm of weeping now, writhing
under this merciless attack, throwing back her head
and tossing out her arms in tragic appeal to him to
stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a ring at the front door.</p>

<p>Nacha started to her feet, and tried to remove
the traces of her weeping. However, it was only
the servant bringing in a letter from Arnedo.
Nacha, dazed, had not the courage to open it. She
asked Monsalvat to read it to her. Arnedo announced
that he was dining that evening with some
friends. Taking the letter Nacha stood motionless
and silent, staring straight before her. When Monsalvat
spoke, she neither answered nor looked up.
A tragic expression settled on her face. She was
trembling violently. Suddenly, raising her hands
to her head, she cried:</p>

<p>"No, no, it can't be! It is madness. Go away
at once! I never want to see you again. I was
crazy. Go, I say!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat looked at her in amazement. He did
not know what to do. Could he have lost her?
Why a moment ago it seemed.... He tried to
speak, to explain. But she pointed to the door with
an obstinacy and an energy he had not dreamed
she possessed. There was nothing for it but to
obey&mdash;but this was an overwhelming catastrophe
falling on his life.... His heart was breaking....
As he left the room Nacha did not even bid
him good-bye.</p>

<p>Arnedo's two lines had sufficed to remind her of
reality, or rather of what she believed reality to be.
With a great effort she stopped weeping and recalling
scenes of the dead past. She was a different
Nacha now; she was Lila, the tango dancer, Lila,
the delight of the cabarets. For a moment, she
forgot even Riga.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>But, towards five o'clock, her heart triumphed
over her will. Suddenly, desperately, fearful of
being late, she put on her hat, rushed to the street,
and took a taxi to the cemetery.</p>

<p>The services had begun. Anxious not to be
noticed, she hovered on the edge of the cluster of
people gathered there. It saddened her to see that
scarcely twenty of the poet's admirers had escorted
him to his grave. When they had all gone, she
drew near to the spot where her friend's body had
been laid. Her handkerchief over her eyes, she
stood there a long time, motionless, clad in black,
silently weeping, an image of Grief itself. The sky
was overcast; the cold drizzle was gradually turning
to rain. As the first gusts reached the mound
on which she lingered, Nacha slowly walked away,
and returned to Arnedo's apartment.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>Monsalvat wondered how, after the events
of the previous night and those of the afternoon,
he could bring himself to dine that evening
in Ruiz de Castro's palatial residence, in company
with various worldly persons of the latter's selection.
Was he not betraying his real self, being unfaithful
to the new Monsalvat, born of his recent
struggles? As he looked about him he could think
only of the contrast between Nacha's unhappy life
and that of these pretty women; and how different
was the tragic dialogue which had occurred between
him and that poor child, from the gay conversation
buzzing about this aristocratic table!</p>

<p>Strange that contact with reality should have
made him forget the occurrences of the afternoon!
At this moment he had only a vague notion of the
things he had so recently been feeling, of the things
he had so recently been doing. He knew simply
that he had just been living hours of intense spiritual
excitement&mdash;an exhilaration approaching delirium,
dominated by an obsession which had severed
every connection between him and his material surroundings,
and left him completely indifferent to
whatever lay outside of his own inner preoccupations.</p>

<p>After leaving Nacha's apartment he had wandered
about the streets for a time. Then, a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
quieted, he had called at the Ministry, less to inquire
about the position promised him than to give himself
something to do. There he met Ruiz de Castro,
who had a few days before invited him to dinner,
and who now insisted on his acceptance for that
evening. He did not refuse. Why should he?
Was he, perhaps intending to withdraw from society
altogether? At any rate, here he was now, surrounded
by elegant women, and by fashionable men
of the world.</p>

<p>Ruiz de Castro, a classmate of Monsalvat's, was
a likable fellow. His principal occupation was making
himself agreeable to everyone, old or young,
man or woman. He was a tall man and held himself
extremely well, though his carefully nursed
mustache, the height of his collars, the variety and
splendor of his cravats, the profusion of jewelry
on his fingers, left a faint suggestion of the Don
Juan and of the fop in the total impression he
made. Never had anyone seen Ruiz de Castro in
clothes which did not look fresh from the tailor's;
and he never failed to wear gloves even on the most
terrible of summer's days. To a small fortune of
his own he had added that of a millionaire's widow.
His principal social hobby was the giving of suppers
and small receptions to persons chosen from the
most select circles of Buenos Aires. A lawyer by
profession, he had read a great deal on all sorts of
subjects and could talk entertainingly on art, and
letters in particular; indeed by virtue of this intellectual
pose, he considered himself superior to his
surroundings. His guests were always men of recognized
talent; doctors, distinguished lawyers, university
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
professors, men prominent in politics or
literature. At such intimate parties these "highbrows"
and their wives, all of whom were art enthusiasts,
talked painting and sculpture, music and
verse. Of course, for this élite, nothing done in
Argentina was of any account. To Monsalvat the
women seemed to be better informed on the whole,
more sensitive and discerning than the men. Of
the ten there assembled, all of them elegant, beautiful,
and witty&mdash;were they not Argentine?&mdash;one
wrote with real talent, though not for the public;
another knew the art and literature of France better
than a majority of Argentine novelists of much
more serious pretentions to learning; still another,
a young woman who was seated near Monsalvat,
had studied philosophy diligently and had even
attended Bergson's seminars in Paris. On this particular
evening they were discussing Rodin, Debussy,
Strauss and Zuloaga whose pictures at the Exposition
had aroused general enthusiasm among the
artists and amateurs of the capital.</p>

<p>Monsalvat felt out of place in this atmosphere.
Most of the young women he had not met until
then, though he had some acquaintance with their
husbands. His being there at all was due to Ruiz
de Castro's affection for him. De Castro, a good
Argentine and a good <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">porteño</i>, instinctively admired
success; and from his law school days had been
wont to see in this young fellow, who always came
out highest in examinations, and delivered the most
impressive dissertations in class, a quite exceptional
being, destined to social and public recognition.
Monsalvat, for that matter, possessed a genuine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
distinction of his own in Castro's eyes. His natural
and simple manners were a delight to the more
sophisticated attorney, as were his quiet and correct
conduct, his way of never calling attention to
himself even by his clothes, his manner of speaking&mdash;which
was not the fruit of careful premeditation,
but the spontaneous expression of a real preference
for simplicity. It was Ruiz de Castro who had
done most to draw Monsalvat towards society,
literally dragging him into the Jockey Club, and
then prompting various of his invitations to society
functions; for the ambitious lawyer felt certain that
a man of Monsalvat's promise would never fail to
do honor to his sponsor; and he was ingenuously
eager out of sincere friendship to have his friend's
personal worth recognized by his own particular
set.</p>

<p>Monsalvat, however, was too modest for the rôle
assigned him: he had an exaggerated fear of appearing
ridiculous. Dread of standing awkwardly in
the limelight, of doing the wrong thing there, always
made him keep his opinions to himself, no matter
how much to the point they might have been. Timid,
lacking confidence in himself and in others, he never
gave anyone a glimpse of his real nature. Only a
few intimate friends, among them the women who
loved him, knew and appreciated his qualities. For
them his was a deep, a noble, a generous spirit,
modest and simple, without ambitions; a man who
lived a satisfying inner life, and possessed an unusually
rich culture. For others he was a colorless
uninteresting individual, a bore and a nonentity.</p>

<p>The subjects touched upon in the conversation at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the dinner-table developed nothing in common between
Monsalvat and his neighbors. Art had never
attracted him; and he knew little about literature.
He had read voraciously, but rarely a novel or a
volume of verse, or of literary criticism. Thus it
was that when the ladies around him talked in dithyrambic
ecstasies of Chabas or Loti, the conviction
that he did not belong in these surroundings, bore
in upon him not without a twinge of shame.</p>

<p>Monsalvat was not then thinking, nor did he wish
to think, of what had so profoundly absorbed him
during the afternoon and the preceding evening.
Nacha's final attitude towards him, the manner of
his dismissal, had deeply humiliated him, and made
him long for the seclusion of his customary mode
of living. What a fool to have believed it possible
to regenerate such a woman! But his dinner-coat
helped him to forget all this, clothing him for the
moment with self-importance, and inclination toward
frivolity. He put his sister, Pampa Arnedo, his
conversation with Torres, all out of his mind.</p>

<p>One of the only two bachelors present among all
these married people, Monsalvat had been seated
between two <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">niñas</i>, "girls," as unmarried women, of
whatever age, are chivalrously called in the Argentine.
The one on his right, Elsa, was a delightful
creature, blond, virginal, with the unspoiled, however
mature, freshness of her twenty-five years.
The rather angelic slenderness of her shoulders gave
her something of the ingenuously innocent appearance
of Botticelli's maidens, with which the burning
roses of her cheeks and lips scarcely harmonized.
But she differed from the paintings of the early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
masters in not having a line that was either angular
or rigid. Roundness, indeed, was the conspicuous
trait in the lines of her figure, the slope of her
shoulders, the modelling of her cheeks and chin.
She spoke with a certain ingenuous and charming
candor, turning to full account her acquaintance
with books and authors, which was remarkably varied.
Monsalvat had known her in Paris five years
before, and had called at her rooms there. He had
observed with astonishment that this Botticellian
virgin had among her favorite volumes the <em>Satiricon</em>
of Petronius, Willy's latest novels, and other productions
of the same outlook on life. Elsa's main
sport was playing with men and their foibles. Her
wide blue eyes, of a surpassing beauty, gazed out
at the world in such fashion that no male could long
resist their spell. She would smile maliciously at
her victim and assail him on the side of vanity,
praising his talents, or whatever claim to distinction
he might have. She would listen to the frankest
allusions&mdash;provoked, of course, by her&mdash;without a
trace of embarrassment or annoyance, though she
herself always avoided improprieties in speech, indeed
every word that came from her lips seemed the
very breath of youthful innocence itself. Nevertheless
there were hostile tongues to criticise Elsa.
When an unfavorable comment reached her ears
she would evince a discreet amount of alarm, and
then smile to show how little importance she attached
to such matters after all. As to love and
marriage she had no illusions. How could she,
when every husband who came her way, no matter
how exemplary by reputation, made love to her at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the slightest provocation? Looking at the world
through <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fin de siècle</i> French novels and the anecdotes
of her friends, she judged it even worse than it is,
seeing in it only the play of gross or perverted
instincts. Never having felt or inspired love, she
could not recognize it in the world about her. As
to her women friends, they interested her so little
that she never thought of inquiring what women
were really like. In her heart she despised them
and thought them poor fools to be talking of the
love their sweethearts and husbands had for them.
She "knew!" On more than one occasion, when she
had heard a husband praised for his faithfulness,
she found a way of having a few moments' conversation
alone with him; and infallibly the model of
fidelity soon was a model no more. Monsalvat had
had with her several diverting and flirtatious conversations.
But now, in his present critical state of
conscience, at the awakening within him of far different
desires, he could not possibly talk with her
in the same tone. The young woman on his left,
addressed as Isabel, had a lively intelligence but few
physical charms. Nevertheless she displayed a certain
attractiveness that evening. She knew how to
make the most of her few good points, chief among
which were her eyes, eager, sympathetic, trusting,
questioning, quick to show embarrassment. Her
face was too long, her mouth too large. Though
her teeth were not pretty, she knew how to laugh&mdash;the
clear, happy laughter of youth&mdash;and she showed
them constantly. Her temperament and ideas were
the exact opposites of Elsa's. Coming from a
family of the old Spanish stock, and of devout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
catholicism, Isabel was always talking "tradition";
while Elsa, from one of the newer families, typified
the modern pagan and cosmopolitan spirit of Buenos
Aires. Isabel was all prejudices and enthusiasms.
She talked excitedly, with passion. She was incapable
even of suspecting the true nature of Elsa's
cynical temperament. To her the world seemed
better than it is. Only unmarried men interested
her, though the idea of marrying frightened her.
Some of the world's injustices were quite beyond
her ken; but she believed that whatever they might
be, one should practise resignation. For priests,
whose words on any theme were pure gospel for
her, she had a superstitious reverence; she believed
them pure and saintly all.</p>

<p>Monsalvat and his neighbors had maintained the
most trifling of conversations. Elsa, as was her
way, tried to give it a suggestion of intimacy, to
which Monsalvat did not lend himself very cordially.
He would have preferred to talk to Isabel.
But was even this pious woman, with her dogmatic
education, her habit of never doubting anything,
likely to understand the complex anxieties besetting
him? He reached the conclusion that he had
nothing in common with his neighbors on either
side, addressed them only when courtesy required,
and directed his attention to the plump young woman
opposite him, a rather amusing person, well-read,
talkative, and critical of things and persons. At
the moment she was running on about the theatres.</p>

<p>"You simply can't go to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Odéon</i>! At least
not on subscription nights! It's scandalous, the
plays those French writers give the public! There's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
never a decent character in them. What right have
they to oblige the people who really support the
theatres to listen to plays full of workmen, strikers,
thieves&mdash;all the rabble! I'm sure I don't understand
why the managers present such stuff!"</p>

<p>Isabel, and nearly everyone else who was listening,
approved the speaker's view of the matter.
Elsa looked at Monsalvat out of the corner of her
eye, and smiled at him. For his part, he felt hot
indignation against this woman who mentioned
working men and thieves in the same breath, and
would have nothing to do with humanity's troubles.
A reply rose to his lips; but he was afraid of appearing
ridiculous, and kept it to himself.</p>

<p>"Tell her what you think&mdash;you ought to!" said
Elsa.</p>

<p>This half mischievous encouragement seemed
suddenly to re-enforce the imperative of Monsalvat's
own conscience. He felt somehow that he
could no longer avoid speaking. With a smile at
the plump lady, he said in a good-natured tone:</p>

<p>"But, dear madame, it is for people like you that
just such plays are given. How else could elegant
and distinguished ladies of your world know anything
at all about human suffering?"</p>

<p>"But," said the devout Isabel, "one goes to the
theatre to be amused!"</p>

<p>"If the show or the book is not to your liking...."
Monsalvat began; but he was interrupted by
several voices, among them that of Dr. Ercasty,
who was sputtering about and exchanging knowing
winks with his neighbors at the table. Dr. Ercasty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
had long had his doubts about that fellow, Monsalvat!</p>

<p>The plump lady's voice rose above the others:</p>

<p>"And why should we be bored with that sort of
thing, Mr. Monsalvat? I don't think I need to.
Of course everyone is free to do as he likes. I
have my own troubles, and I believe everyone has
at some time or other; but I don't go about unloading
them on everybody; so why should I be made
to listen to other people's tales of woe? Anyway,
they don't ever show us moral struggle, but just
hatred, crime, and insults to society. If there are
people who are hungry, why don't they work? But
I don't care to go to the theatre to hear about things
that don't interest me, and that I can't help; and I
care even less to hear myself being blamed for all
sorts of things I never heard of. The other day
I saw an impossible thing called "Élise of the Underworld."
I never was more disgusted! What on
earth have we to do with that kind of women? No,
Monsalvat, you are defending ideas that I know you
can't really believe in."</p>

<p>Ercasty nodded congratulations to the plump lady
and good humoredly suggested that Monsalvat had
better throw up the sponge in the argument.</p>

<p>Ercasty was a physician, though he had abandoned
practice to fill an important government position.
In addition to a prominent paunch, and forty
years of experience in this world, his chief distinction
was his bland adeptness in the use of weapons
little known in Argentine society&mdash;paradox, irony,
sarcasm. In spite of his smoothness, however,
Ercasty was a dangerous foe. When wounded he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
could fight back like a lion at bay. Reactionary
in everything, he would make no terms with democracy,
liberalism, or even individualism. "Society"
was his god. "Society" provided him with the ideas
and sentiments he lived by. To express an opinion
contrary to those approved in the best society,
seemed to him a breach of good form, an offense
as obnoxious as a crime. Years before, when Monsalvat
was writing for the <em>Patria</em>, the articles which
"Society" had so much applauded, wherein, with
talent and learning, he justified all the iniquities
usually defended by daily newspapers, distinguished
persons, fashionable writers, and all good Christians
who interpret the teachings of Christ to the advantage
of their own worldly self-seeking, Ercasty had
been a good friend of his. Now the doctor would
have enjoyed seeing him come to a violent end.</p>

<p>"Don't plead the cause of those people, Monsalvat,
for Heaven's sake!" exclaimed the plump
lady.</p>

<p>"Of what people?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the rabble, the bad people, 'the people,' in
short!"</p>

<p>"The sovereign people!" offered Ercasty contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Don't defend them!" continued the lady. "See
what they tried to do last May, just when we had
a lot of very distinguished foreigners here, ambassadors
and their wives, representatives of European
nobility even! They wanted to make someone pay
for their own laziness! So they tried to cast discredit
on their own country, and spoil the Centennial
celebration&mdash;a disgusting performance if ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
there was one! What can our distinguished visitors
have thought? And to take advantage of such an
occasion to gain their ends! There's no name for
such conduct, Monsalvat!"</p>

<p>"And if I had been the government," said the
doctor venomously, "I would have taken all these
gringo organizers, soap boxers, agitators and strikers,
and the bad Argentines who followed their
example, stood them in a row on the Plaza de Mayo
and shot them down. That would have been a
number on the Centennial program, and example
to the rabble!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat could listen no longer. He was quivering
with indignation. Usually serene, quiet, and
incapable of hating anybody, he would at this moment
have enjoyed strangling the individual who
was taunting him so flippantly. Now he realized
that all the men and women around him were his
enemies, representatives of his old out-worn ideas,
of prejudices which he had come to abhor. On
their faces he could see only insolent satisfaction
with good living, a proclamation of inhuman selfishness,
a spirit of evil, hypocrisy, pride, an absence of
all human sympathy. What were their lives but
one continuous lie? These men and women had no
real existence. They were insipid creatures of
something they called public opinion, thinking the
thoughts of their crowd, following the morals, the
standards, the tastes, the fads of their crowd!
Their opinions were but a false semblance of opinion,
their feelings but imitations of other people's
feelings, their tastes, even their loves and their
hates, mere aping pretense! Life for them was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
gigantic farce. Had any of them ever thought of
living sincerely, of seeking any meaning in all they
were doing? And these people with their accommodating
philosophy, their pretentious political
economy, their hypocritical charity, were responsible
for the poverty in the world, for the misery of girls
like Nacha, for the sufferings which social injustice
was heaping up on every hand! Why had he had
to live forty years before understanding this? How
could he have sat at this table a whole hour, forgetting
all he had been through that afternoon?
But no! he was not sorry he had come! Henceforth
he could have no doubts as to his place in the
general scheme of things: he belonged in the front
line of the attack on pride and falsehood and evil!
All these individuals around him were so many tools
in the hands of Injustice; and someone must put an
end to their privileges, their ideas, their unfeeling
self-approval! At any cost, even at the cost of
blood and fire, brotherly love must be made to prevail
over brute force! These men who called themselves
Christians must be taught what Christian love
really meant!</p>

<p>And the young ladies, the one on his left and the
one on his right? To him they seemed instruments
of Wrong, monsters of selfishness, beings without
hearts. One represented the selfishness of pleasure,
the other, the selfishness of class. They could think
only of themselves, of their amusements, their
clothes, their reading, their suitors, their pet vices,
or of their religious and social practices. To them
the world seemed quite satisfactory as it was; and
everything could go on in the same way to the end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of time. In them there was no strong, spontaneous
desire for the happiness of others. They were innocent
of any attempt to relieve the pain of those who
writhed in anguish in the world's black depths.
They were little china figures, fashioned to adorn
the society in which they lived, interested in knowing
only the pleasant aspects of life. Now and
then, from a play or a book, they received tidings
of some one of life's tragedies; but always they
turned away with disgust: such things were not for
their fragile and aristocratic souls! Monsalvat was
amazed at the ignorance, the unconscious cruelty
their attitude toward life brought with it; and he
could not help thinking of the outcry rising from the
great city's multitudes who might some day clamor
for vengeance as well as for justice!</p>

<p>But at the same time Monsalvat wondered if his
present views might not perhaps be due to an attitude
toward society engendered by his illegitimacy.
His enemies would say so at any rate. They would
attribute his bitterness to consciousness of his shameful
birth, suspect him of trying to avenge his
mother's disgrace on society at large. With how
much truth? With none, whatever! Of that he
was sure. For beyond all such considerations, the
question of justice itself remained; and this justice,
unaffected by personal wrongs, superior to any mean
satisfactions, condemned Evil as Evil, and indeed,&mdash;it
could not be otherwise&mdash;had decreed already
the death of all that Monsalvat so intensely hated.</p>

<p>At last, when he could no longer contain the indignation
burning within him, he began to speak;
and the consternation was general. Ruiz de Castro,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
who knew that his friend was an exceptionally timid
person, loath to attract any attention whatever,
stared at Monsalvat in astonishment. The doctor
kept executing fidgety gestures of annoyance and
tried a number of times to interrupt. Isabel seemed
to be agreeing with Monsalvat's tirade, but refrained
from committing herself since she was
unable to decide whether what she was hearing was
for or against religion. Elsa was enjoying the
whole situation as if this outburst were a new kind
of lark. She sat looking at Monsalvat with smiling
delight.</p>

<p>What was he talking about? Of social inequalities;
of the fact that some of us have millions while
others cannot buy even bread: that some of us live
in great palaces set in handsome parks; while others,
in dank, filthy, tenements, exist in a monstrous
promiscuity which pens ten and twelve human beings
in one room; that some have a superfluity of everything&mdash;property,
comfort, pleasure, culture, education&mdash;and
that this superabundance does no one any
good, since it does not go to those who lack everything;
that some women possess dozens of costumes
and necklaces worth thousands of dollars&mdash;every
kind of luxury and ornament&mdash;while other women
have to sell their bodies, give up life, health, their
very souls, barely to clothe their nakedness, to have
just enough bread to keep alive!</p>

<p>"Well, why don't they work?" the plump lady
who had been listening horror-struck angrily inquired.</p>

<p>"Because they can't get work, madame! Because
work, as things are now organized, is another privilege
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
which we selfishly keep for our own purposes.
I don't know how it happens that all the masses we
trample on have not risen to exterminate us!"</p>

<p>Indignant protests greeted this explosion. Elsa,
vastly entertained, laughed and applauded. Isabel
became definitely hostile. All he was saying she
had finally concluded, was contrary to the views
of the Church Fathers. How frightful! The
plump lady was quite frankly calling Monsalvat an
anarchist, an assassin, and an enemy of the established
order.</p>

<p>The guests had risen from the table and gathered
into small groups. The plump lady seemed determined
to argue with Monsalvat. Ruiz de Castro
approached them, smiling.</p>

<p>"Are you two bent on rearranging the whole
universe?" he asked in a tone of conciliating banter.</p>

<p>"Do you know, this Monsalvat has become a
dangerous anarchist!" the woman replied.</p>

<p>"Yes! Nothing is so dangerous as telling the
truth!" was Fernando's rejoinder.</p>

<p>"But some individuals are even more dangerous
than the truth&mdash;the dreamers, I mean. Isn't that
so?" Ruiz de Castro addressed the remark to the
plump lady.</p>

<p>"Certainly! And just consider what Monsalvat
was saying about those women! Why, he was practically
blaming me for the fact that&mdash;that they&mdash;well,
you understand. Indeed you understand these
matters only too well! I believe that what is wrong
with all those creatures is that they lack the fear
of God. Before giving themselves up to such a
life they ought to beg, take places as servants, go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to houses of charity, bestir themselves at any rate!
There's no lack of work...! Let them do like
the men; but instead of turning into anarchists or
socialists and going about from strike to strike, they
ought to submit to the will of God, and resign themselves
to their lot! As we all have to!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true," exclaimed Isabel, emphasizing
the last word as if she were impressed in advance
by what she was going to say, and with all the conviction
of a person who has found a clinching argument.
"That is very, very true! Why stir up
strikes? It's so wrong, so wrong!"</p>

<p>The plump lady added with a sigh of melancholy
resignation: "Everyone must accept his lot in life!"</p>

<p>"When it is yours," said Ruiz de Castro, smiling,
"one can well afford to think so. But I, instead of
your lot, would choose your husband's!"</p>

<p>"Mine?" she exclaimed, passing over this gallantry.
"But we are almost poor! I can't say we are
actually hard up; but aside from my husband's salary
as deputy, we have nothing but the rents from
a few insignificant pieces of property and a farm
near Buenos Aires. Still, I don't complain. Others
have millions&mdash;Very well! I don't envy them: I
accept God's will."</p>

<p>Monsalvat began to wonder why he was lingering
among these people, the object of their general contempt.
For that matter, he had no right to be
there. He took leave of his hosts and went away.</p>

<p>The night air cleared his brain; but how tired
he was, how sick! As he walked on, he began to
feel in better spirits. He would have no more to
do with what he called organized Injustice. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
saw now the road he must henceforth follow. Good
dwelt with the oppressed; and the only work worthy
of a man was to fight for the down-trodden. He
would give his life and the little money he had to
the poor of the earth. People said he wanted vengeance?
Very well! That would be his vengeance!</p>

<p>It was midnight when he reached his rooms;
there dissatisfaction with himself came over him
again. He took off his evening clothes, and tossed
them carelessly aside. His thoughts reverted to
Nacha. Why had she dismissed him after listening
so long to him, after confiding her own history
so intimately? Could he have fallen in love with
her? Was this the explanation of his actions that
evening? Oh, Nacha, Nacha! What would he not
give to see her, for even the hundredth part of a
second!</p>

<p>As his eye wandered about the room, he saw a
letter lying on the table. It was from his mother.
She was asking him to come to her for she was very
ill, and believed death near. A few seconds later
Monsalvat was hurrying in a taxi toward Lezama
Park.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>Monsalvat's mother had been a very pretty
girl; but at sixty she possessed not even the
remnants of her earlier beauty. Aquilina Severin
had left her parents' modest shop to work at a
fashionable dressmaker's establishment on Florida
Avenue. One fine day Fernando's father met her
on the street, made love to her in due form, and
succeeded in winning her. Aquilina was twenty
when her son was born. Soon after this her lover,
Claudio Monsalvat, married a girl of his own social
position; which did not prevent his giving Aquilina
an allowance and visiting her from time to time.
Ten years later a girl Eugenia, came into the world.
Claudio had made over a piece of property to Aquilina,
but died without bequeathing anything to his
natural children. Their mother had urged them
to contest the will made wholly in favor of the legitimate
family; but Fernando, then in Europe, refused
to consider such a suggestion. His mother lived on
the two hundred or so <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> which were the income
from her property, until she sold it on the advice
of an attorney of the neighborhood. The proceeds
of the sale were turned to good account by various
speculators; and shortly thereafter Aquilina found
herself in the street, penniless. From that time on
her son supported her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Of scant native endowments, Aquilina Severin
had had little education, and remained a stupid,
incompetent woman. The comforts supplied by
Claudio represented the height of wellbeing in her
eyes. She believed herself a fine lady, deserving of
the world's envy. Her parents had not been married,
and she had none of the current prejudices in
favor of legal unions. She considered love the important
thing in these matters and had for that
sentiment a high regard, though the word "love"
had a very elastic scope in the usage of this unfortunate
derelict.</p>

<p>Her daughter's education, under the circumstances,
could only be disastrous. Fernando at various
times tried to take a hand in his sister's
training. He advised his mother to send her to
school, and to discourage certain of Eugenia's undesirable
friendships. But Aquilina always replied:</p>

<p>"And why? What will she get out of it? I never
went to school, and I came out all right! I know
what I am doing, and it's nobody's business!"</p>

<p>Eugenia therefore got her schooling in the streets.
She spent her days with other small girls on the
sidewalk, or on the window balconies, where her
graceful figure and fine black eyes attracted plenty
of attention. When Eugenia was twenty she made
certain attempts to overcome the waywardness naturally
resulting from this bit of mistraining. She
even tried to get work in a shop. But Aquilina
objected, saying that the pay was an insult, that the
girl would kill herself with work, come to look old
before her time, and by accepting such a lowly station,
harm her father and brother in the bargain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
It was Aquilina's desire that Eugenia meet some rich
or distinguished man who would fall in love with
her and set her up in an establishment of her own.
She knew that no one but a laborer or some socially
insignificant person would marry her daughter; and
she preferred one of those extra-legal arrangements
which she took as a matter of course without the
slightest scruple. Aquilina could conceive of nothing
better for her daughter than a situation resembling
her own. She believed romantically in eternal love,
in everlasting fidelity&mdash;and in men's promises! She
never spoke of these ambitions to her daughter,
much less to her son; but Eugenia divined something
of them just the same.</p>

<p>In the house next door lived a family of position
and wealth. One of the sons of the family was
wont to make eyes at Eugenia whenever he caught
sight of her, without going so far as to speak&mdash;out
of fear for Fernando perhaps, who in those days
used to visit his mother two or three times a week.
One day Aquilina observed to Eugenia in a tone
which expressed her meaning even more clearly
than did her words:</p>

<p>"Now we'll see if you can land your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau</i>....
He's a fine young man&mdash;and he's rich!"</p>

<p>"But, mother, do you think he will marry me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. We'll find that out later; but if
he's reliable, and faithful, and affectionate, it doesn't
matter much."</p>

<p>She stopped at the look of disgust and sadness in
her daughter's eyes; for Eugenia, curiously enough,
was a very normal girl at bottom. She wanted a
husband and a home, but from all she had heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
her mother say on this topic, she believed that,
preliminary to "landing" men, it was necessary to
angle for them.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Aquilina took into her
service the woman, Celedonia, who from then on,
for ten years, was her constant companion. Celedonia,
a talkative, rather handsome creature, and
of mixed blood, kept the whole neighborhood busy
talking scandal about her. Fernando frequently
begged his mother to get rid of her; but for Aquilina,
her new servant was the most entertaining of
company. She brought home all the gossip of the
block; the deceptions practised by supposedly rich
people to make an impression at little expense; the
quarrels of husbands and wives; the love affairs of
daughters or servants; the pranks of the men in the
various families; the vices, in short of everybody.
During Carnival, Celedonia always went, in costume
and mask, to the balls at the Victoria Theatre,
where she encountered others of mixed blood like
herself. The next day she would come home, still
half drunk, and spend the afternoon telling her mistress
what she had seen. To Aquilina these stories
of low-life were like a window opening on a world
of gaiety denied her. She would rock with laughter
at the anecdotes, enjoying descriptions of things of
which she could have no experience, and almost
envying Celedonia her good times. Sometimes
Eugenia too was present, listening to these stories;
and it never occurred to her mother to cut them
short on account of her daughter's presence.</p>

<p>Not long before Fernando left on his second trip
for Europe, Eugenia made Arnedo's acquaintance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
He was a bold, handsome, domineering youth, apparently
good-natured; and it did not take Eugenia
long to fall in love with him. The first time he saw
her, as he chanced to be passing the house she lived
in, he made clear, in unmistakable fashion, what a
profound impression she made on him. Catching
sight of her in her doorway, he stopped a moment,
on the sidewalk, then took up a position on the street
corner; after a while he walked past her several
times and finally approached. Eugenia, who was
alone, stepped back a little; but Arnedo snatched at
her hand, and in an imperious tone, ordered her to
stay.</p>

<p>"But someone may be coming!"</p>

<p>"I don't care. I am crazy about you!" he declared,
in a simulated burst of emotion.</p>

<p>They talked awhile. They told one another their
names; and Arnedo as he caressed her hand, declared
a consuming passion. For several evenings
they continued their conversations in the vestibule.
Eugenia never doubted Arnedo's sincerity when he
promised to marry her very soon.</p>

<p>From that moment Arnedo was her master.
Aquilina and Celedonia knew what was going on
but did not interfere. The girl's mother believed
that here at last was the man she was hoping for;
and she was quite confident that her daughter would
know how to manage him; Celedonia was not the
one to discourage such conduct, surely.</p>

<p>Fernando was in Europe when Eugenia ran away
with Arnedo. Her mother imagined that this was
a desirably decisive act. She did not quite understand
it, for the young people could perfectly well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
have taken her into their confidence; but she thought
that perhaps methods in these matters had changed
since her youth. As for Eugenia, she was quite
ready to believe, when Arnedo took her to his quarters,
that the affair was "serious." Nevertheless
Arnedo left her at the end of a year. Eugenia returned
to her mother's; and Aquilina's only reproach
was on her lack of skill in managing men. For
several weeks the girl was keenly conscious of shame,
especially when she met her acquaintances of the
neighborhood. One day she decided that she could
no longer live with her mother, whom her presence
in the apartment disgraced; and besides her
mother's toleration of her conduct was extremely
distasteful to her. She went away, leaving no word
as to where she was going. For several months
Aquilina had no news of her.</p>

<p>Eugenia's first flight had not been mentioned to
Fernando; but when letters from her ceased to come
he demanded an explanation. On his return from
Europe, he got the whole story; Eugenia was living
somewhere with Arnedo&mdash;this was all the mother
knew. Fernando was not only distressed, but somewhat
alarmed at this news, which, he believed, might
harm him in his profession if it were widely known.
His sister's conduct had a great deal to do with his
leaving the country a second time, and remaining
away for seven years.</p>

<p>Since his return Fernando had visited his mother
very little, in spite of her ill-health. The mulatto
woman, whom he intensely disliked, was always
present during his interviews with her. Once he
had suggested asking her to leave the room; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Aquilina begged him not to do so. For that matter
Celedonia needed no authorization from her mistress
for what she did or did not do. She ruled the
establishment as absolute sovereign, managing Aquilina's
funds, and sharing life with her mistress on
equal terms. Aquilina adored her son, but she could
not prevent the mulatto's exhibiting some of the
hatred Monsalvat inspired in her; and the very
natural effect of this was to discourage his visits.</p>

<p>When he reached the apartment that night, he
found the outer rooms crowded with people. This
convinced him that his mother must be dying; and
with a sinking heart he rushed to her bedroom. The
mulatto and another woman were there preparing
hot applications; and he noticed also a young girl
of some twenty years who appeared both pretty and
respectable.</p>

<p>Monsalvat brushed the women aside and leaned
over to kiss his mother.</p>

<p>"Have you sent for the doctor?" he asked turning
around.</p>

<p>"Doctor! Why a doctor?" exclaimed the mulatto
scornfully. "Here is Mamita Juana, who
knows more than all your doctors put together!"</p>

<p>Without replying, Fernando went to the door and
addressing the men gathered there asked if there
was anyone who could deliver a letter for him at
once. A gray-haired old fellow with a long beard,
his shoulders bent, and his clothing quite disreputable,
pressed forward, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember me, Doctor Monsalvat?
Don't you remember Moreno, the attorney? That's
me! Why, we worked together once!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsalvat remembered that he had given this
man employment in his office for a short time. Later
he had found the old fellow again, earning a miserable
pittance from odd jobs in the law courts.</p>

<p>Monsalvat took a pencil from his pocket and
wrote something on a card, while Moreno went on
talking:</p>

<p>"Here I am, Doctor, still alive, and that's some
job! Those days are over&mdash;my law days, I call
them. Don't think I'm stuck on myself; but just
the same I'm proud of the work I did back there.
The law in this country of ours owes me something,
Doctor! I helped it along. We took part in some
big law suits, and we won them. I say 'we' because,
after all, the other fellow did his share of the work.
And here I am, Doctor, with ten children on my
hands, poor as a rat, and going down hill fast...."</p>

<p>In spite of his shabbiness, Moreno still possessed
some of the manners of a more cultivated society
than the one that now knew him. He smelt of
cheap whiskey and his person was none too clean;
but the semi-obscurity of the hall was to his advantage.</p>

<p>"Deliver this letter to this address at once. Take
a cab, and wait for an answer! Bring Dr. Torres
back with you."</p>

<p>Fernando gave him some money, urged him to
hurry, and was about to return to his mother's bedside
when a woman near by said:</p>

<p>"Don't let him go alone, sir. He'll stop for a
drink in the first saloon he sees."</p>

<p>"This is the companion of my sorrows," proclaimed
Moreno, "and see how she treats me! She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
owes me everything; I have given her ten children
and my name, raising her to my own social position&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's just talking, sir. We have no ten children&mdash;only
seven. He thinks you'll give him some money."</p>

<p>The woman was half angry, half smiling; and the
others standing around, who seemed to have quite
forgotten the sick woman, burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"You'd better let my husband go with him," said
one of the women, pointing to her man.</p>

<p>"All right. Will you?" asked Monsalvat.</p>

<p>Moreno, with an offended expression, placed one
hand on his chest, and declared oratorically:</p>

<p>"Doctor, what has been said is offensive to
my...."</p>

<p>"Stop talking, my good Moreno, and hurry, if
you please!" Monsalvat interrupted. "I'll pay you
well for your trouble."</p>

<p>"At your orders, Doctor, whatever you say," the
man replied, inclining his head in humility. "It's
you that asks it, sir, and I'll do anything for you!
Just as in those distant days which never will return,
Moreno, Attorney at law, will always...."</p>

<p>The man who was to accompany him grasped his
arm and hustled him away. Fernando returned to
his mother's room.</p>

<p>Aquilina was seriously ill. From her rapid pulse
Monsalvat guessed she must be suffering from a
heart attack. But what was there to do? He
thought of cold applications and asked the girl,
Moreno's oldest daughter, to prepare them. The
woman quack remained in the room, partly enjoying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the prospect of witnessing the doctor's failure,
and partly bored. Celedonia sat at the bedside,
casting contemptuous glances at Monsalvat.</p>

<p>"Leave me with my mother," he ordered, and the
women went out, grumbling.</p>

<p>When Aquilina found herself alone with her son,
she began to weep. Up to this moment she had
been overwhelmed by the fear of death. But now
her son's presence seemed to comfort her.</p>

<p>"Fernando," she began, when she was able to
speak, "I have been a bad mother. If I could only
see Eugenia before I go! Look for her ... find
her ... so that she will come tomorrow. I was a
bad mother I guess! It was my fault she went
away! I knew what she was doing; I allowed her
to go on."</p>

<p>Fernando tried to console her, assuring her that
she was exaggerating her responsibility. He was
sincere in this, for he could not believe his own
mother had consented to her daughter's wrong-doing.
In the miserable wretch before him he could
see not a bad but an ignorant woman, doomed by
her own foolishness, and by the circumstances of
her life.</p>

<p>"Yes, a bad woman," repeated Aquilina. "After
Eugenia had given herself up to a bad life, I let her
come here, and I let her give me money. At first,
after Arnedo left her, she came back, and wanted
to be a good girl. But Celedonia couldn't let her ... and
I knew it all the time. Oh, Fernando, can
you forgive me? Can you forgive me for all the
harm I did you, too? I saw more than once how
unhappy you were on account of me. If I had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
a good mother, I would rather have died than harm
you!"</p>

<p>Fernando scarcely heard the words. His mother's
confession had made him draw his hand away, instinctively.
He sat with his elbows on his knees, his
hands clasped, his eyes closed. What pain this was,
penetrating to every fibre of his body! His mother's
self-accusation gave him a sense of unendurable
shame; but at the same time the load of responsibility
resting on his shoulders seemed to grow
lighter. Aquilina had grown quieter after making
her confession; and now he, too, felt a certain
measure of peacefulness creeping into his heart.
When he first listened to his mother's strange words
he thought he was going to hate her, loathe her;
but now, on the contrary, he loved her more than
before. All the pity he was capable of seemed too
little for this poor, foolish, dying mother of his;
he began to sob, kissed her, put his arms around
her with a tenderness which was the poor woman's
only comfort during those moments.</p>

<p>"Mother, it is my fault, not yours," he assured
her, when he could speak. "I intended coming to
tell you so, even before you sent for me. All the
responsibility is mine. I have had a better chance
than either you or Eugenia; I knew more about
life, and I should have taken care of you, both of
you, protected you&mdash;tried to educate you. That
was the task I should have set myself! Instead, I
came here as little as possible, because I didn't
want to be reminded of the facts I hated. I never
really took any interest in you. Eugenia owes me
nothing, because I never gave her anything; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
never spoke to her openly, frankly; I never helped
her by word or act. Instead of staying with you
both to take care of you, I went to Europe, to get
away from my mother and sister, to forget them."</p>

<p>"I brought disgrace upon you. You are paying
for what is my fault, Fernando."</p>

<p>"No, it is not your fault! Something far more
guilty than you is to blame! But, never mind! All
this is very far away from us now, mother. At
last I have come to know myself, and to know the
world we live in."</p>

<p>Aquilina suddenly grew worse. Fernando, anxiously
waiting for the doctor, sent Moreno's wife
to watch for him at the street door. His mother
seemed to be struggling for breath, and he thought
oxygen would help her.</p>

<p>"You must find Eugenia," she gasped. "I need
to know that she forgives me. Look for her ...
tell her...."</p>

<p>Fernando was afraid to think where he might
find Eugenia. What had become of her by this
time? His thoughts turned to Nacha; and he
wondered if those two had perhaps met. Nacha,
Eugenia!... Surely his was a strange destiny,
to have spent all his life far from this class of
women, and now to find himself taking a part in
their lives. Nacha! Eugenia! Was he in love
with Nacha? If not, why did he think of her all
the time even on such an occasion as this one?
And where would such a love lead him? If he
found Eugenia, he would take her to live with him.
Why should not Nacha live with them also, in
fraternal companionship? Eugenia, Nacha! The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
two seemed only one now. Their souls, their lives,
even their forms, seemed to blend into one haunting
symbol of human sorrow. Selfishness, ignorance
and evil were their relentless enemies, and worse
than any of these was the smug indifference of the
prosperous.</p>

<p>The doctor's arrival roused him from his ponderings.
Torres sent him at once for some oxygen,
and he took Moreno with him.</p>

<p>In the hack he asked the old attorney if he
knew where to find Eugenia. Moreno knew perfectly
well, but he did not wish to part with his
information too lightly. He assured Monsalvat
that he did not know, but that he could find out.</p>

<p>"It will be a hard piece of work, doctor; but as
long as it's for you.... I'm pretty hard up.
You see how it is...."</p>

<p>"I'll give you whatever money you need. But
you are to bring her to her mother's the very first
thing in the morning, understand?"</p>

<p>Moreno promised. He began to talk of Eugenia,
of her beauty, of the luxury amid which she
was reported to be living. It was a shame ...
but what could be done about it? And he added
philosophically, as if it might console Monsalvat:</p>

<p>"You mustn't take it too hard, doctor. That's
the way things go in this world."</p>

<p>When they returned to the apartment with the
oxygen, Aquilina was dead.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>The fit of anger during which Nacha had ordered
Monsalvat out of her house had quite
passed by the time she returned from the cemetery.
She could only marvel at her sudden refusal
to hear more of what but a few moments before
had offered her starving life the ideal it craved.
Nevertheless, the regretful gentleness pervading
her now was due undoubtedly to the soothing effect
of her visit to Riga's grave. The thought of
the dead poet made her repent of her sudden
harshness towards Monsalvat. After that silent
leave-taking from her friend, how indeed could she
help yearning to turn away from the life she was
leading?</p>

<p>And yet could she accomplish that? No practicable
plan occurred to her; Monsalvat might have
helped; but she, stupidly, had driven him away.
Strange how certain she felt, nevertheless, that he
would not continue offended, that he would forgive
her for everything in the end. Still, it was not
probable now that he would look for her. Where
could she find him? What were his occupations?
What places did he frequent? Alas! she knew
nothing of him at all, except his name.</p>

<p>By some strange confusion in her imagination,
the figures of Monsalvat and Riga began to blend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
in her memory. She could not think of one apart
from the other. Was there, perhaps, some spiritual
resemblance between them? Outwardly they
were such different men. Monsalvat gave an impression
of serenity, of poise; Riga, on the contrary,
seemed all nerves, all tension. What had
Riga, weak, sensitive, the typical neurotic, the
creature of whim and circumstance, to set against
Monsalvat's strength of mind and will? Evidently
this courageous stranger who had broken
his way into her intimacy so suddenly had most of
the requirements for success. Riga was one of
those men born to fall of their own weakness, even
before the battle of existence overwhelms them.
But both were generous, high-minded, incapable of
envy, or meanness of any kind. What good luck
to have met a friend like Monsalvat at just this
moment! And what an irreparable misfortune to
have lost him forever!</p>

<p>When Arnedo came home early in the evening,
he brought his friends, and their women, with him
as usual. Nacha was once more lost in gloom.
She tried to talk, and jest in the spirit of the party,
but her words seemed to stick in her throat, and
her laughter had in it no note of gaiety. Moreover,
all her attempts to conceal her real state of
feeling were useless. Arnedo and his companions
were not to be deceived; and Pampa's face openly
expressed the displeasure he was experiencing.
Finally he called one of the other men to an
adjoining room and Nacha, suspecting something,
and listening intently, overheard this dialogue between
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you get rid of her, old man? When
a woman goes around looking like Good Friday all
day long...."</p>

<p>"She never used to be like that. There was no
one could beat her when it came to dancing, and
seeing that things went right in the kitchen, and
dressing, and singing and playing, and entertaining
people generally. She always gave a fellow a good
time, Nacha did. She was good-natured, full of
spirit, and...."</p>

<p>"Well, what's happened to her, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Anyhow I'm going to let her go.
You know, I told you about that matter, down at
Belgrano.... Well, it's just like this." And
Pampa gave a claw at the air with his fingers
closing.</p>

<p>"I see," his companion replied. "So you've got
a substitute for Nacha! What about today's trip
out there? Anything doing?"</p>

<p>Nacha did not care to listen further. She joined
the other girls, and was now apparently in better
humor. When the two men came back she plunged
with deliberate fervor into the merriment, reaching
out for the champagne, and pretending drunkenness&mdash;not
for Arnedo's edification, indeed; she
knew now that her fate was settled&mdash;but to leave
a good impression on all these people whom perhaps
she would never see again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the memory of Monsalvat and of
Riga was vivid in her mind; their image looked up
at her from the hollow of her wine glass; she
seemed to see them standing in the doorways, their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
eyes sad with reproach; now they were directly in
front of her, now she felt them by her side. One
of Arnedo's friends was speaking, and she thought
surely it was Monsalvat's voice she heard and was
about to call his name. Later she had the impression
that Riga was about to come into the
room; and she actually looked around at the door&mdash;not
without some alarm, on her companions'
account. How terrified they would be at this intrusion
of the dead! Arnedo and his guests were
talking of the Centennial celebration; of "shows"
and cabaret performances, of chorus girls and
races. There were three women and four men at
the table, only one of the latter in evening clothes.
All of them had been present in the cabaret at the
time of the quarrel with Monsalvat; and, since that
whole occurrence was not an ordinary one, they
soon began to discuss it.</p>

<p>"Who was that fool?" asked "the Duck," who
had led the chorus of burlesque weepers in the
cabaret.</p>

<p>At this question everyone looked at Nacha, who
sat there anxiously shifting her eyes from one to
another of her inquisitors.</p>

<p>"Why," drawled Arnedo, with an air of importance
nevertheless, "he is the brother of one of
my best conquests. Don't you all remember Eugenia?"</p>

<p>Nacha turned cold. Did Monsalvat know?
Where was this Eugenia? Was she, too, part of
"the life"? Ah, yes; that was it! That explained
Monsalvat's actions, and his fervent words
of that afternoon. So, then, he was not in love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
with her! The interest he showed in her was the
interest he had in all girls sharing his sister's lot.
How stupid not to have thought of that before!
Of course! How could a man like Monsalvat care
for an outcast like "Lila," like Nacha Regules!</p>

<p>Another guest, the man in the dinner-coat, a
tall and skinny youth, whom his companions, out
of regard for his large-boned nose, called "the
Parrot," declared that Monsalvat wrote for the
<em>Patria</em>, where articles had appeared signed with
that name; whereupon all four men felt moved to
express their scorn for this "literary fellow," a
man who spent his time reading trash and writing
nonsense and could only be an utter ninny. These
young descendants of Moreira were, for that matter,
quite sincere in the contempt they voiced.
Products of the aggressive money-making illiteracy
of the Argentine, they instinctively hated the "intellectual"
as a menace to the power of their class,
and could not look upon students and scientists save
with disdainful hostility. From their point of view
any man under forty who lived for something besides
"a good time" was beyond comprehension.
They despised books and newspapers; for they
vaguely realized that in these lay a power of intelligence
destined sooner or later to put an end to
the half-breed barbarism incarnate in themselves.</p>

<p>As the dinner went on, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patoteros</i> tried to
exhibit their brilliancy. But wit for them consisted
at best in anecdotes of the sort known in Argentina
as "German jokes"; in pelting one another
with bread pills; or in suddenly bursting out with
some deafeningly loud rendition of a snatch from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
a music hall ballad. One of their best numbers was
"the Duck's" weeping act, his most successful parlor
stunt. Then "the Parrot" would rise from his
place, disappear, and return wearing a woman's
hat; or Pampa, flourishing his revolver, would pretend
he was fighting a duel, seasoning his antics
with picturesque obscenities from the jargon of a
well-known vaudeville act. The others, meanwhile,
acted as chorus and audience, laughing, and contributing
an assortment of musical accompaniments.</p>

<p>Nacha was now quite merry; she began to sing,
beating time on her glass with a spoon. The
others took up the suggestion, and improvised an
orchestra. "The Parrot" jumped up on the table
to conduct, the others remaining in their places.</p>

<p>"Get down off of that!" yelled Arnedo.</p>

<p>The maid stopped in the doorway, doubling up
with laughter at this uproarious scene. Shrieks,
explosions of mirth, snatches of song, the clink of
glasses, exclamations, and words from the gutter
mingled in a deafening din. Suddenly it occurred
to Nacha to begin a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">jota</i>. Arnedo rushed at her,
clasped her in his arms and bellowed:</p>

<p>"That's the way I like to see you, my little
nigger!"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Nacha, throwing him off,
"but what about your 'nigger' in Belgrano? You
can do without me, now that you've found someone
who can stand you!"</p>

<p>Arnedo stopped short, paralyzed for the moment.
Then his eyes slowly went the rounds of
his friends. Befuddled as he was, he could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
remember to which one of them he had mentioned
this affair. He turned, finally, on Nacha.</p>

<p>"Who told you that? Come, speak up, this
moment. Have you had a detective trailing me?
You're mean enough to!..."</p>

<p>Nacha looked at him in astonishment, pretending
she did not understand.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? What did I say?"</p>

<p>Arnedo staggered towards her, an arm lifted to
strike. Nacha covered her face with her hands to
ward off the blow. The man was beside himself
with fury. It was not so much that Nacha knew
about his adventures; he had boasted of them to
her more than once himself. What irritated him,
because it lowered his prestige with his "crowd,"
was the fact that she was breaking with him.
That was his right!... And that she had found
a pretext for doing so.... Besides, he got it
into his head that Nacha was going to Monsalvat;
and the thought that the man he had offended was
turning the tables on him was unbearable. A new
idea, however, suddenly thrust itself upon him.</p>

<p>"Was it one of these girls who told you?" he
broke out, facing the two startled women.</p>

<p>"What's it all about?" asked one of them.</p>

<p>"This is the first I've heard of it," declared the
other.</p>

<p>Arnedo seized his glass, which was full of wine,
and drained it at a gulp. He stood brooding for
a few seconds at the table; then, thrusting his right
hand inside his belt, he cried out to the man with
whom he had been talking when Nacha overheard
him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now I remember! Of course it was you....
You thought you'd play a joke on me by blabbing!
You always were a dog; but now you're going to
pay up!"</p>

<p>Therewith he jerked out his revolver and began
pointing it about in various directions. His friends
seized his arm, but in healthy fear of an accident,
refrained from any effort to take the weapon from
him. The scene was well on its way to a bad end,
when a man named Amiral walked in upon the
group.</p>

<p>This fellow, the perfect type of the impoverished
rake, was always to be found hovering about some
couple or other, never under any circumstances accompanied
by a woman; he would have to pay for
her drinks. He shared the champagne other people
bought, rode in taxis other people paid for,
and even gathered a few crumbs from other people's
love affairs. Very tall, very thin, with extremely
long arms, skeleton-like legs, a wan face,
thick up-turned mustache, and bulging, glassy eyes,
he was far from prepossessing in appearance.
Though his perpetual penury made him something
of a joke with women, Amiral was born for "gallant"
adventure. In the eighteenth century he
would have been a Marquis of Marivaux or a
Count of Goldoni, prodigal of love and madrigals.
In the less favorable present, his position in society,
such as it was, derived from his trips to
Europe.</p>

<p>In Argentina there is no more valid claim to
consideration than foreign travels. The oftener
one goes abroad, the greater one's "prestige," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Amiral "went across" every two years. He travelled
parsimoniously, carried his own luggage,
never used a cab, and was extremely sparing of
tips. Generally he took lodgings in Paris, where
he lived on borrowings from his fellow-countrymen.
He knew nothing of the French capital save
the life of the boulevards, of the Abbaye de
Thélème, of the cabarets, and of the furnished
apartments on the Chaussée d'Antin. However,
in Argentina, this was readily marketable knowledge;
a number of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patotas</i> tolerated Amiral for his
amiable discourses on the gay life of Paris. His
inevitable stock in trade was to expatiate on the
theme that Buenos Aires had "no atmosphere";
and could the authority of such a widely travelled
man be questioned in these matters? When, in the
circles he frequented, the discussion turned to
women, someone could always be heard to quote
Amiral's oracular utterances: "Amiral says that in
Paris..." and the point under discussion was
settled.</p>

<p>"Why, my good friends, what's all this, anyway?
Are you rehearsing for the movies?" said
the new arrival, coming into the room with his
accustomed laugh, his grotesque arms describing
absurdly elongated arcs in the air.</p>

<p>"Why, you boys aren't serious, are you? Oh,
say.... Really now, good fellows like you...."</p>

<p>The intervention had a quieting effect on Arnedo,
who put his revolver away. One of the women
tried to explain the scene to the newcomer, but
Amiral held her off at the ends of unbelievably
long arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no! No post mortems, please! The act
is all over, my young friends. Now for a merry
little interlude. Come, bring on the suds! Say,
girl, hasn't Pampa got a couple of bottles of champagne?
I like mine dry."</p>

<p>The servant made haste to obey the order.
Amiral punctiliously drank a toast to the mutual
love of "the Arnedos," and once more laughter,
shouting, dancing, clinking of spoons on glasses,
general uproar, became the order of the evening.
Arnedo, supported by the hilarious demands of
the company, insisted that Nacha declare she had
no intention of leaving him; and yielding to this
unanimous pressure, she obeyed. Thus, under
Amiral's protection, a reconciliation was accomplished.
Arnedo took Nacha from her place and
made her sit on his lap, while jests at this public
flirtation began to fly back and forth.</p>

<p>The first bottle had been drunk, and they were
making good headway with the second, when Nacha,
who had been gradually returning to her
depression, burst into tears:</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" asked Amiral.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing!" Arnedo growled. "Show her the
label on a bottle and she gets one of these fits."</p>

<p>Now completely succumbing to the champagne,
her face distraught and her arms and body twitching
in absurd gestures, Nacha began to talk in a
rambling, incoherent jumble of words that moved
the company to uncontrollable hilarity.</p>

<p>"I loved him so much, and he died!" she moaned.
"He was here this afternoon, and he told me he
loved me; and now he is dead. There never was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
another man like him&mdash;so good, so brave! No
one else would have done what he did in the
cabaret&mdash;Carlos Riga was his name. Oh, poor
girl that I am! He told me I would suffer&mdash;that
I must suffer&mdash;but I want to live&mdash;to live&mdash;I want
to live and to suffer! He said he would be my
friend. Why did he do that? And then go and
die right afterwards? Everyone who loves me
goes and dies! You're laughing at me! Why?
Isn't it the truth? I may be all you say I am,
but I know what love is, and I'm not going to
leave this house...."</p>

<p>"She has a fine one on, has Nacha!"</p>

<p>"That's a shine for a cloudy day!"</p>

<p>But Nacha had lost consciousness of everything
about her. Her eyes were heavy with sleep. She
sagged forward in her chair, till her head rested
on her arms, and, still at the table there, she fell
fast asleep.</p>

<p>It was late the next day when she woke in bed;
and the servant was bringing her a note from
Arnedo. In it he explained that he did not care
to have her remain a moment longer under his
roof, that she was free to go to Monsalvat or to
whomever she preferred. With the message he
enclosed a hundred <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peso</i> bill.</p>

<p>Nacha read the letter without emotion. Her
first thought was one of shame at the spectacle
she must have made the night before. As for
Arnedo, she was glad to have her relations with
him end in this fashion. A sudden and immediate
break&mdash;yes, that was better! It was clear he was
still fond of her, otherwise he would have told her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
to go himself, or have had the servant put her out.
Consideration for her feelings to such an extent as
the letter showed was an incredible act of delicacy
on Pampa's part, had he been serious! She was
tempted to remain, just to go him one better.
But no! She was through with Pampa and his
kind. Monsalvat had told her she was a good, a
noble woman, at heart. Could she not be, if she
tried? Try she would, at any rate.</p>

<p>She wrote a few words to her former lover,
assuring him that she bore him no ill-will, and
returning the hundred <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i>. Then she quietly
packed her belongings, dressed, had her trunk carried
downstairs, and getting into a cab, gave the
driver the address of a boarding house she had
selected from a list in the <em>Patria</em>. "Strictly respectable,"
the advertisement had declared. Nacha
felt quite elated now. To herself she seemed
to have already gone a long way on the road to
respectability.</p>

<div class="chapter">

</div>


<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>The shock of his mother's death, and quite
as much the story of Eugenia she had told,
left Monsalvat for some days in a veritable stupor.
He just let himself live on, listlessly yielding to
the stream of passing hours much as water-grasses
in mid-river bend and curl to the current. His
mind was a blank, incapable of thinking, unresponsive
alike to memory and to hope. At intervals,
indeed, in some chance moment of awakened introspection,
it occurred to him that this present
spiritual passivity must be very like Nacha's habitual
condition&mdash;a barely conscious drift down the
course of events, thoughtless, will-less, purposeless.</p>

<p>But such spiritual torpor could not last long in
a man of Monsalvat's vigor. Eventually he began
to feel the need of action, and two immediate
projects seemed to present themselves: he must
find his sister, and he must attend to the restoration
of his tenements.</p>

<p>One morning the broker he had commissioned
to execute the mortgage announced that he had
drawn up the necessary papers, and that they were
ready for his signature. A bank was advancing
forty thousand <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> on the security of the improved
property. Monsalvat gaily hurried to announce
the news to his tenants. To his surprise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
he saw no results of the various measures toward
cleaning up which he had suggested to the janitor.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you carry out my orders?" he asked
the latter, a lean, loose-jointed immigrant from
Aragón, whose arms bobbed up and down against
his enormously wide hips as he talked with a
slightly Andalusian lisp that had the intention of
humor in it.</p>

<p>"I have, sir, I have. But these people&mdash;why,
sir, what can a fellow do with them? Take a
look at them! Born pigs, pigs they will remain."</p>

<p>His labored jocularity failed, however, in quite
concealing the uneasiness the man was feeling at
this unexpected visit from his employer. As Monsalvat
started for the door of the tenement the
janitor resumed:</p>

<p>"Going to talk to them? What's the use?
They'll only lie to you. What such folks need is
the stick, I'm telling you, and not kind words,
nor favors."</p>

<p>But brushing him aside, Monsalvat went on into
one of the apartments on the ground floor, the
door of which was open. In it lived an Italian,
with his wife and two children. The man, a
laborer on some municipal building job, was away
at work. Monsalvat asked the woman if the
superintendent had conveyed his orders to her.</p>

<p>"There! Didn't I tell you?" the janitor commented
triumphantly, at the reply that he had not.
And he added, with a burst of ill-natured laughter,
"The people, the sovereign people&mdash;pah!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat invited the fellow to leave him
alone with the tenant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"How much did you pay this month?" he inquired
when the man was gone.</p>

<p>Foreseeing a raise in her rent, the woman put
her apron to her eyes and began wailing about the
poverty, debts, and sickness in her family. Monsalvat
repeated his question.</p>

<p>"Twenty <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i>," she replied, trembling.</p>

<p>Monsalvat had ordered his caretaker to reduce
the rents by a half, and his face flashed with anger.
The woman, however, misinterpreted her landlord's
expression, which she thought due to surprise
at the smallness of the sum. Now, surely,
he was going to raise the rent. Oh, this America!</p>

<p>So from apartment to apartment Monsalvat went
on pushing his inquiries. Some of the tenants
were not in, but he managed to visit a dozen or
more of them. It was the same story everywhere.
He hurried down to the superintendent's quarters
and ordered him to assemble all the tenants in the
courtyard. When they had gathered there, he
denounced the trickery of his agent and discharged
him on the spot.</p>

<p>"Your rents are reduced by one-half," he then
explained to the crowd. "But this will not be for
long, because I am going to make some expensive
alterations. I want you to be comfortable in
clean homes, with plenty of air and sunlight. I
want you to live like human beings, and not like
animals. When the contractors begin work here
you will probably have to move to some other
house; but later when this building has been made
a fit and pleasant place to live in, you can return
here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>To his astonishment, his words were welcomed
with no enthusiasm whatever. Instead of pleasing
his listeners, indeed he seemed to have insulted
them. Some commented with a shrug of their
shoulders; others began whispering together. One
old woman burst out weeping. A man who talked
with a Galician accent voiced the protest that was
in all their minds. They were being put out of the
house, just as a pretext for higher rents afterwards.
Calling the man by name, Monsalvat tried to
explain.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand? I am thinking only of
your own good. If you live under hygienic conditions,
with plenty of air and light, you will have
less sickness, and lose less time from your work.
Life will be that much easier for you, anyway."</p>

<p>But the man did not understand. If they were
satisfied, why force on them something they did
not ask for? They lived like pigs? Well, had
they ever lived any other way? Hygiene and air
were all right for rich people. But poor folks had
always gotten along without air; and as for hygiene,&mdash;what
was hygiene anyway but some new
fad of the white-collared crowd? Anyway, if poor
people had a hard life, the rich needn't try to improve
it with their uplift. Everybody knew only
too well what rich people were like. If they were
easy with you one moment, it was only to take it
out on you at some other time. Mr. Landlord
could leave them alone with his lower rents and
his remodelled tenements. They wouldn't have the
lower rents, and they wouldn't move a stick or
stone out of there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>The Galician looked defiantly at Monsalvat as
he talked. His auditors, evidently a majority of
the tenants in the building, loudly applauded his
concluding words.</p>

<p>"He's right! He's right!"</p>

<p>And Monsalvat saw more than one hostile glance
coming his way. Disheartened now, he did not
care to reply. What could he say that he had
not said? Merely assuring them again that the
month's rent for each apartment would be ten
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> instead of twenty, he went away, leaving his
tenants to continue discussing their grievances together.</p>

<p>As he walked toward his lodgings, he tried to
convince himself that this incident was not a proper
cause for discouragement; that, on the contrary, it
emphasized the need of going on, of struggling
with these people, even against their wills, for
their own good. Their ignorance was the natural
consequence of such absorbing poverty. When had
culture ever existed apart from a certain amount
of material wellbeing? And how really poor in
every sense were these unfortunate tenants of his;
their minds dulled by the grind of daily toil, their
vision blurred to the most obvious beauties of life.
It was understandable, indeed, that they should
mistrust everything, even the best intentions of people
who really had their welfare at heart. But he
was sure of his road now; all doubt and faltering
had left him. The difficulties he encountered only
spurred him to new energy and a light was shining
in his heart.</p>

<p>He had reached the steps leading up to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
house when someone, from a carriage window,
beckoned to him to stop. It was Ruiz de Castro,
smart, dapper, gloved and perfumed as usual, bearing
himself with his customary correctness and as
always looking quite the conqueror. And following
him out of his conveyance came Ercasty, who
greeted Monsalvat with an affected courtesy quite
in contrast with his obvious annoyance at this
encounter.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," Ruiz exclaimed, "you have
no idea what an uproar you caused the other night.
I have been busy apologizing for you ever since."
And he laughed with his characteristic mannerliness,
trying to appear amused as though it were all
a joke. The doctor, however, eyed Monsalvat with
aggressive hauteur, gazing skyward with intentional
rudeness, whenever Fernando began to speak.</p>

<p>"Certainly it would never have occurred to anyone
but Fernando Monsalvat to defend those
women seriously." Castro continued: "All the
ladies have decided you must be the wildest libertine
in Buenos Aires. Something of a reputation,
eh?"</p>

<p>"The injustice of such an inference must be
rather obvious," said Monsalvat. "It offends me,
however, only in the abstract, as something wrong,
and therefore ugly. So far as I am concerned personally,
it is nothing to me at all.</p>

<p>"I shall continue being what I am&mdash;regardless
of what people think." The doctor, much annoyed,
suddenly abandoned his passive attitude.
It was incompatible with his veneration for "society"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
to admit that an individual could be other
than what "society" declared him to be.</p>

<p>"That is sheer nonsense," he broke in aggressively.
"What counts is public opinion. A man
is, in any practical sense, exactly and only what
people consider him to be."</p>

<p>Monsalvat took no notice of the interruption.</p>

<p>"I am not sorry that I spoke up in defense of
those poor women," he said, addressing his remarks
to Ruiz de Castro alone. "I assure you,
we do not know them. To us they seem like animals,
things without souls, without personalities.
Well, we're wrong. They are human beings. They
feel, and love, and hate, like any one of us. But
even though it should not be so, granted they are
virtually animals, whose fault is it?"</p>

<p>"It's idiotic to blame society for the manner of
living of these people," the doctor asserted roundly.
"They behave as they do because they are
degenerates."</p>

<p>"No, not degenerates: victims! Many of them
try to work. Pitiful salaries, with debts they can't
avoid, drive them into the power of vice. A few
of them may, indeed, be degenerates&mdash;off-spring of
feeble-minded or alcoholic parents for whom, in a
more roundabout way, we are perhaps just as
much to blame. But, on the whole, the cause of
the social evil, as of other evils, is in me, in Ruiz,
in you, in the man going by there in that automobile,
in the factory owner, in the store proprietor,
in the criminal laws which give a sanction to economic
injustice, in our moral ideas, in our conceptions
of life&mdash;in our civilization, in short. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
fact is, we have no human sympathy, no sense of
justice, no pity. Countless numbers of these poor
girls might still be saved, because they have not
yet completely lost their self-respect. But what
have we ever done to rehabilitate one of them?
Do we ever go into the places where they live with
any purpose but a shameful one? Do we ever
extend the hand of Christian fellowship to the
outcast? Can any one of us say that he has never,
even by tacit complicity, helped to bring about the
degradation of any woman? No, we are all the
accomplices, witting and unwitting, of an infinitude
of crimes. And yet those girls are our sisters;
creatures, as people say, with souls to save, unfortunates
feeling the same call to life that we all
feel, and, like all of us, destined to the death that
engulfs all our hopes and all our sorrows...."</p>

<p>Ruiz de Castro, from temper of mind, and in
spite of the circumstances in which life placed him,
was not insensible to an idealistic appeal. His face
showed the impression Monsalvat's words made on
him. Not so his companion, however, who in
this case, as in all others, was quite indifferent as
to whether Monsalvat was right or not. For him
the important point was that the whole discussion
annoyed him, as something improper, in bad taste.
It was Ercasty's belief that an educated man like
Monsalvat, a "gentleman" in other words, ought
to have the ideas and sentiments of his class. In
defending workmen and prostitutes, and other
kinds of low people, Monsalvat, in his opinion,
was behaving like a vulgar plebeia. The doctor
would have conceded to anyone the right to defend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
fend such unfortunates in the conventional way&mdash;with
condescending charitableness, or with witty
paradoxes; but this fellow was talking like a social
agitator; attacking society, insulting class, ignoring
tradition. What were policemen's clubs for except
to use on such dangerous lunatics? As Ruiz and
his companion bowed him a cold "good day,"
Monsalvat went up toward his front door. Chancing
to turn around before going in, he caught a
glimpse of the doctor still sputtering abuse in his
direction. For his own part he pitied the man,
with that exultant sense of superiority which a
new vision brings.</p>

<p>As it was still only eleven o'clock, he decided to
go at once to the house where his mother had
lived, for a further talk with Moreno. At the
door he met the latter's daughter. Monsalvat had
first noticed Irene Moreno the night of his mother's
death, and he had taken a liking to her. She had
been so gentle, so affectionate towards Aquilina
Severin, so skillful in tending her, so ready to do
anything she could. The sight of the poor child
now caused him a most painful impression: slight
of frame, but graceful, nervous, agile, under a
shock of almost blonde hair, she seemed a pretty
little flower that was being trampled upon, bruised
and soiled in that life of the tenements. To atone
for the utter incompetence of the father, she and
her mother sewed, embroidered, and in other ways
made frantic efforts to assemble the pennies needed
for the daily bread of that household. To Irene
fell the care of her six younger brothers and sisters;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and it was she who delivered her mother's
and her own needle work at the stores.</p>

<p>"I am going next door for a moment," the girl
replied to a question from Monsalvat, looking up
at him shyly out of her dark, steel blue eyes.
"There is a woman there who has just lost her little
boy. He was only two years old. The poor thing
is a widow and has no work."</p>

<p>"Won't you take her something from me&mdash;from
us both?"</p>

<p>"I have something already," Irene answered.
Knowing the circumstances of the Moreno family,
Monsalvat wondered how much such alms could
amount to; and Irene, though much embarrassed
by his insistence, could not evade confessing that
she was taking the woman one <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peso</i>, the total of
her ready cash. Monsalvat put into her hand all
the money he had in his pocket, not daring, however,
to suggest that she keep that poor little <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peso</i>
for herself. Then he followed her back into the
Moreno apartment. Moreno was out, as usual.
That systematic ne'er-do-well was scarcely ever at
home if he were sober enough to be elsewhere.
His wife, too, was absent, for the moment, trying,
as Irene explained, to place her eldest son as an
errand boy somewhere. With the children running
in and out, hungry, squawling, half-naked, the
rooms were in a disorder, which Irene, visibly
troubled at being taken thus unawares, kept trying
to excuse, betraying her uneasiness further by a
constant fluttering of the eyelids which, to Monsalvat,
somehow seemed particularly appealing.</p>

<p>Monsalvat turned the conversation, as soon as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
possible, upon the subject of his sister, whom Irene
said she also had known. "Eugenia was such a
generous girl," she added. "I grew to be very,
very fond of her. And she dressed so wonderfully!
People said she had piles of money. But
she was always doing something for somebody.
She never forgot to bring us some little present
whenever she called on Aquilina; and I remember,
too, that she never went away without telling me
to be a good girl. That always amused me. But
Eugenia was so pretty!"</p>

<p>"And did she ever mention me?" Monsalvat
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Irene, "often! Though she seemed
to feel you did not much approve of her."</p>

<p>"And where is she now? Do you think your
father will really find her?"</p>

<p>Irene reddened, and seemed reluctant to answer.
When Fernando repeated his question she replied
that her father certainly did not know where Eugenia
was. No one did, for that matter, as
Eugenia never would tell her address. Moreno
was just trying to get money out of Monsalvat.
"And please don't give him any more," she begged.
"He only drinks it up, and he always makes a lot
of trouble for us here in the house when he gets
drunk."</p>

<p>In Irene's opinion, it was useless to look for
Eugenia. No one had any idea as to where she
was living. It would be better just to wait. She
would turn up sooner or later to see her mother.
Then they would tell her about the poor woman's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
death, and let her know that her brother was
anxious to see her.</p>

<p>"And tell her, too, as simply as you can, Irene,
that I hold nothing against her; and that I want
her to come and live with me."</p>

<p>Monsalvat spoke with an emotion which, without
his being aware of it, found a responsive chord
in Irene's starved little heart. As their eyes
chanced to meet, Monsalvat divined that this poor
child was in love with him.</p>

<p>"And you," he exclaimed, "why haven't you
some kind of work?"</p>

<p>"I've looked for work, outside, but without
much success. We take in sewing, you see, mother
and I. She knows how to embroider, and she is
teaching me how to do it. But we make so little
at it."</p>

<p>Irene's eyes filled with tears, as memories of
her hardships rose before her. While Monsalvat
sat silent, moved by what he heard, she told him
that Moreno sometimes beat her; but that was
nothing to the agony she endured when the children
cried with hunger.</p>

<p>"I can't bear it. It breaks my heart to hear
them."</p>

<p>And she began to sob. Monsalvat tried to comfort
her, and talked to her awhile, as a brother
might. Suddenly he got up to leave. Nacha's
image, persistent and irresistible, was taking possession
of him. Irene gave a quick glance at him
and saw that he was going. Seizing his hand, she
threw herself on the ground before him.</p>

<p>"Take me with you!" she cried. "I will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
your servant, your slave, anything you wish, because
I know you will help mother and father&mdash;and
the children. It will be your bread they eat.
Only take me away, please. I love you, I respect
you. If you don't take me, what's to become of
me? I'll go away with the first man who comes
along. Yes, I will! I'll be like Eugenia&mdash;but at
least the family won't starve."</p>

<p>"Please get up," said Monsalvat, embarrassed.
They stood facing one another. Saddened and
silent, he looked at her.</p>

<p>"A year ago I would have taken you with me,
Irene. Now it is impossible. But you don't need
to humiliate yourself to persuade me to help your
people. They shall have everything I can give
them. Now, promise me you will not do anything
foolish. I shall be your friend, and come to see
you."</p>

<p>Irene, without replying, went into a corner of
the room, and began to weep heart-rendingly.
What could he do? Profoundly distressed, Monsalvat
went away.</p>

<p>All day the thought of Irene troubled him; but
towards evening he decided he must make two
calls: one upon Nacha, the other upon Torres.
It was impossible to wait longer; he must see
Nacha, and as to Torres, he needed his help in
looking for Eugenia.</p>

<p>He went to Nacha's apartment. His jerk at the
bell brought him suddenly face to face with Arnedo.
He turned cold.... The latter surveyed
him from head to foot, in utter astonishment.</p>

<p>"So it's true she was carrying on with you, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
it? What did you come here for? To find her?
Don't you know I threw her out ten days ago?
She's probably running around the streets, like the
rest of her kind."</p>

<p>He tried to make his tone scornful; he did not
want to betray the anger Monsalvat's presence
aroused in him. But Monsalvat had recovered his
self-command. Quite serenely he declared that he
had had nothing to do with Nacha. The proof
of this was that he had not until that moment
known that she had left. If there had been anything
between them, wasn't it rather strange that
ten days should pass without their seeing one another?</p>

<p>"Just the same," said Arnedo, yielding to this
argument, "you have no business to come here.
And you can get out at once. If you don't, I'll
throw you down those stairs!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat was unruffled. He looked into Arnedo's
eyes with so quiet and peaceable an expression
that the latter could not but restrain his violence.</p>

<p>"Why do you take things that way?" said Monsalvat.
"I wish you would listen to me with a
little patience. I did come to see Nacha, not with
the intentions you may have supposed, but for her
good. I know that she wants to lead a decent
life. Don't you think it is only just and human to
encourage her? If you have ever cared for her,
don't stand in her way now! At least let her save
herself, if she can!"</p>

<p>Arnedo listened, his hands in his pockets and his
eyes on the ground. At first he wanted to laugh;
for this all seemed so ridiculous, and sentimental.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
But suddenly he became serious, as though Monsalvat's
words were sinking in.</p>

<p>"But it isn't only on Nacha's account that I
came. I also wanted to talk with you. I wanted
to ask you where Eugenia Monsalvat is."</p>

<p>He spoke gravely and in a tone which seemed
to make an impression on the young <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patotero</i>.</p>

<p>"My mother has died, and she asked me to look
for her. I want to keep my promise that I would.
No one knows where my sister is, Arnedo. Do me
a kindness and tell me."</p>

<p>"I don't know where she is. If I find out...."</p>

<p>As they parted, they shook hands. Arnedo was
beginning to understand Monsalvat. He knew
that this man, who seemed to have forgotten the
scene in the cabaret, was no coward; that there
was in him something that he had known in no
one else. He went with Fernando to the elevator
and again shook hands with him.</p>

<p>Monsalvat found Torres in his office. In order
not to add to his friend's shame and grief, the
doctor listened without looking up. Monsalvat had
found it easy enough to speak of his sister to
Arnedo; but to speak of her to Torres&mdash;what an
effort it cost him! And he had something even
harder to do; he must tell him he was also looking
for Nacha. Torres would think that he was in
love with the girl, and perhaps laugh. Yet, when
Monsalvat, with a tremendous effort, told him
that there was need of finding Nacha, too, Torres
gravely replied that Nacha must be found.</p>

<p>For he, too, was beginning to understand Monsalvat.</p>

</div>


<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>The boarding house to which Nacha had
fled belonged to an old maid of French extraction
known as Mlle. Dupont. This elderly
landlady quite won Nacha's heart with her amiability
and delicate ways, her politeness and her
unquestionable respectability. Poor Nacha had
never in her whole life been so well treated; the
years she had last lived through had prepared her
to be particularly surprised and pleased by the attentions
with which she now found herself surrounded.
She attributed to kindliness and goodness
of heart the courtesies which were due to
"Mademoiselle's" punctilious ceremoniousness; and
she thought that her landlady did her a great
honor in demonstrating so much affection for her.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Mlle. Dupont had as many
wrinkles in her soul as on her face. Her apparent
amiability expressed itself chiefly in certain phrases
of endearment or pity such as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma petite</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma chérie</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oh, quel malheur</i>! and others of the same nature.
To hear her, one might have thought that to this
sensitive being everything was delicious, enchanting,
exquisite, worthy of compassion or sympathy. The
daughter of Bayonne Protestants, she had turned
Catholic, and was, at bottom, a narrow, egotistic,
rather ridiculous old woman. She treated all her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
boarders as she treated Nacha, and was prodigal
to them of similar amenities. She must have been
about forty-five; but she looked more than fifty.
She was tall, angular, stiff in her movements, with
masculine features, and hair and eyebrows of a
reddish cast. Her nose was sharply molded, and
her hair, combed high in an ancient style, covering
the greater part of her forehead and her ears, and
hanging down the sides in ringlets that were not
always in curl, gave her a somewhat ludicrous
appearance. When she wished to appear particularly
sweet-natured, she would lean ceremoniously
toward the person addressing her, all the while
smiling and blinking her small eyes.</p>

<p>Mlle. Dupont would quite frequently visit Nacha
in her room.</p>

<p>"Always alone!" she would exclaim, clasping her
hands, and shaking her head. "Would you care
for a little company?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; I'd be delighted!"</p>

<p>Then she would sit down beside Nacha and tell
her what a fancy she had taken to her, and how
she hoped she would never leave her house, and
how much she enjoyed her.</p>

<p>"You are such a good girl, Nacha!"</p>

<p>"Oh, 'good,' Mademoiselle!"</p>

<p>Her landlady continued in eulogistic strain; and
then came the moment for exchanging confidences!
She wanted to know "everything" about her new
friend, about her family, about the kind of work
she had done, and what she lived on.... Nacha
trembled before this curiosity. What should she
reply? Such questions from anyone else would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
annoyed her; but in "Mademoiselle's" case they
seemed prompted by the affection she professed for
her new friend, and a desire to be useful to her, and
to know her better.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to know?" Nacha would ask.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mlle. Nacha! Nothing! Nothing at all!
You wouldn't believe me if I told you&mdash;it's just because
I'm so fond of you, you are so good, so&mdash;how
shall I say&mdash;so innocent!"</p>

<p>Nacha reddened. Mlle. Dupont, watching her
out of the corner of her eye, and a little constrained,
reddened also. "Oh, I can tell at a glance! You
are not like some of the other girls I have known.
As for me I admire goodness so much that I cannot
understand how some women ... I don't know
how it is! ... you see I was brought up on very
religious principles; and I can't help having such
high standards about character that I really can't
endure the thought of the slightest slip.... No,
I always say; let a woman have all the faults she
likes: but let her morals at least be above reproach!"</p>

<p>Nacha, terrified, was wondering if "Mademoiselle"
knew anything about her life; but she could
only conclude that her being allowed to remain
under that roof at all proved that her hostess was
in total ignorance of her history. All these declarations
of lofty principles and integrity of character,
confirmed by the obvious austerity of her daily life,
caused poor Nacha to look upon Mlle. Dupont as
a superior being. Here at last was someone worthy
of her intense admiration! She went so far as to
try to model her conduct upon that of her landlady,
and avoided going out, believing that temptation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and vice hovered outside the precincts of that house
of refuge.</p>

<p>So she remained all day long in her room, going
over the incidents of the day just passed, dreaming,
wondering who Monsalvat could be, and what he
wanted of her. Was he really what he appeared?
Or had he practised a miserable deception on her,
making use of his eloquent words to get her away
from Arnedo, for his own advantage? This was
not impossible; for to men all means are justified
when the end is the woman their caprice has fastened
upon. And she could not doubt that she was
pleasing to Monsalvat. She remembered how he
had looked at her, the first time they had ever seen
one another, in the cabaret; he had followed her
to the house&mdash;he had gone again to the cabaret to
see her&mdash;and then how he had defended her! It
couldn't be merely out of pity that he had risked
incurring the insults and the violence of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patota</i>!
Does a man take such risks except for love? No,
there could be no doubt: he was in love with
her....</p>

<p>But, did she want him to be? What was the
strange feeling she had for the man? Love or hate?
Sometimes she thought she loved him with all the
strength of her being; but when she remembered
that she was now without resources, and that she
would sooner or later be forced to have recourse
to the means of livelihood so loathsome to her, she
hated him. Why had he come to her house to torment
her? Why had he spoken to her that way,
knowing as he must that a woman of her kind is
an outcast, and cannot change the manner of life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
that makes her so? Was he perhaps a lunatic, who
took pleasure in doing her harm? Her head swam
with all these questions and uncertainties. Then
again at times she reproached herself for having
driven Monsalvat away. How happy it made her
even to remember that he had thought they might
be friends!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nacha was living on the money she
had raised by pawning a few jewels. She was sorry
now not to have accepted the sum Arnedo had offered
her. Why so many scruples about accepting
money? They became her strangely! Mlle. Dupont
required payment in advance; so that she had
had to part with a small brooch on the very day
of her arrival in the boarding house. The jewels
she still possessed were of a very modest sort and
would scarcely provide her with means for even a
month.</p>

<p>When she left Arnedo's apartment it was not
with the intention of trying to lead a decent life.
Convinced that she could not help being what she
was, she had resolved to go on making a living as
before. But now two things held her back; the
memory of Monsalvat, and her regard for Mlle.
Dupont. Never, while in that house, could she fall
short of her "Mademoiselle's" ideals! The Frenchwoman's
eloquence on the subject of "character"
had impressed her. She felt the charm and the
tranquillity of living respectably; and it was not
merely the happy freedom from remorse which
soothed her: the decency within her seemed, at last,
to have found a home.</p>

<p>More helpful than anything else, however, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the thought of Monsalvat. In spite of her apparent
evasion, he had conquered her, leaving on her spirit
an ineffaceable imprint. Simply remembering him
made it impossible for her to take up again her
shameful profession; and when, hard pressed by
need of money, or by habit of mind, she thought of
yielding, Monsalvat's image appearing before her,
imperious yet kind, strengthened her impulse to
resist.</p>

<p>A month and a half passed while Nacha lived
on in a beclouded dream, completely inactive. She
got up at eleven, lunched with the other boarders,
spent the afternoon in an easy chair, dreaming, reading,
letting her somewhat indolent imagination wander;
or she would lend herself to confidential chats
with "Mademoiselle." She almost never went out.
In the evening, after dinner, she joined the other
boarders at their card games, and then went to bed
late.</p>

<p>She did not care to call on her friends, for fear
they would drop in to see her and compromise her
with "Mademoiselle." Sometimes she thought she
would go out to try to discover Monsalvat's whereabouts;
but she knew nothing of his occupations,
his associates, or the places he frequented. She felt
certain that his being in the cabaret was quite accidental,
and that, as he could scarcely hope to see
her there, he would never go back.</p>

<p>She had spoken of him with some of the other
people in the house, but they knew nothing she did
not already know. One of them mentioned having
read an article of Monsalvat's in the <em>Patria</em>, and
Nacha telephoned to the newspaper office to ask
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
for Monsalvat's address. However, no one there
knew it.</p>

<p>On the few occasions when Nacha went out it was
with Mlle. Dupont. One afternoon the latter insisted
on Nacha's accompanying her to a "meeting."
Nacha, curious, and eager for diversion, accepted
the invitation, and together, they drove to a house
in Independence Street. On the door Nacha saw
a sign bearing a proper name and under it the legend
"Happiness taught here." Beyond this door, in a
room of small size, were several benches and chairs,
occupied by a scattering of people. An individual,
who looked like a Gypsy, was standing before this
audience addressing it. Just as Nacha and Mlle.
Dupont came in, he gave the order "Grand Chain!"
and Nacha could not help laughing at this reminiscence
of a country dance. "Mademoiselle" looked
solemn reproof at her. The participants in the performance,
men and women, as soon as they heard
these words, took hold of hands and stood in a
circle until the Gypsy-like performer, with a sanctimonious
air, announced that "the spirit" had taken
possession of him. One of the audience asked the
spirit several questions, which the man answered in
a faint, doleful, ghostly voice that seemed to come
from beyond the tomb. When the questions were
disposed of, Nacha, who had been frightened at
first, wanted to speak with Riga. If she could only
ask him what she should do! but she did not dare.
Besides it was late and the man announced that the
séance was over.</p>

<p>After their return to the house Nacha and Mlle.
Dupont could talk of nothing but the spiritualist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
meeting. Mademoiselle was a fervent believer in
all such manifestations, which did not prevent her
being an extremely devout Catholic, and the esteemed
friend of some French priests who frequently
called upon her. Nacha inquired of "Mademoiselle"
if spirits knew everything.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah, mais oui!</i> Everything&mdash;the past, the future,
what one ought to do&mdash;they can tell you everything,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma, chère</i>!"</p>

<p>"They are better than cards then? Or fortune
tellers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, much better, cards sometimes lie, but spirits,
never, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma petite</i>, never! How could a spirit lie!
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais ce n'est pas possible, mon amour!</i>"</p>

<p>Nacha liked to have her fortune read from cards
at frequent intervals. Now she thought she would
prefer to talk with Riga, the "professor of happiness"
acting as medium. Riga would not lie to her.
Nevertheless, on the two or three other occasions
when she went to a spiritualist séance she had not the
courage to ask that Riga's spirit be summoned. It
was not so much shyness nor shame which held her
back, as fear&mdash;Riga would be sure to reproach her
for her manner of living....</p>

<p>But one day a strange thing happened! Nacha
unwittingly came upon Mlle. Dupont in circumstances
so compromising to that lady that Nacha,
confused, and distressed, thought only of relieving
her friend's embarrassment. Nothing, thought
Nacha, but her entire confidence could show Mlle.
Dupont that she still held her in high regard. So,
swayed by a generous impulse, she told her hostess
the story of her own life. And when she had done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
so Mlle. Dupont turned upon her with a request for
the month's rent!</p>

<p>Another crumbled illusion! Nacha wept bitterly
over its ruins. It was faith in this woman's strength
which had helped her all this while to resist despair;
now she had lost the only refuge she knew in the
whole world; and tomorrow she would lose what
would cost her more than either of these: she would
lose hope in herself. She would have to go back
to the world which had doomed her to a disreputable
life, which would allow her to live no other....</p>

<p>She decided, however, before taking any other
measure to meet Mlle. Dupont's demands for
money, to call on Torres for help. But, the next
day, early in the morning, the servant told her that
one of the priests who frequently called on Mlle.
Dupont wanted to speak to her. Nacha went to the
parlor. Father Duchaine, round of figure and of
face, sat there waiting for her. His gestures too
were round, as were his short fat fingers; and he
spoke with a round little mouth. Nacha did not
conceal her astonishment at this unexpected call.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, the fact is...."</p>

<p>He stood, apparently searching for words with
which to state the fact, gazing at the floor, placing
his right hand on his mouth, and taking it away
when his meaning required the elucidation of a
circle described by a fat arm in the air.</p>

<p>"You know Mademoiselle! Such a saint! Her
parents, although they were not Catholics, were
good people, God-fearing, virtue-loving. Providence
was watching over our dear Mademoiselle!
When they died, her aunt, a good religious woman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
took her to live with her; and in this aunt's house
Mademoiselle became a convert."</p>

<p>Nacha, gazing wide-eyed at the priest, wondered
what this was all about.</p>

<p>"Well, you know, you understand of course&mdash;in
short, it seems that your life has not been exactly&mdash;what
can I say&mdash;exemplary! Perhaps I am not
clear.... You know, you understand, that in this
house ... where ... how shall I put it?..."</p>

<p>His eyes rolled upward, and he wriggled in search
of elusive phrases. His arm beat the air when suddenly
the desired words slipped into place, and
beaming, he exclaimed, "where virtue is crystal
pure! You see that you ... with your way of
living ... and no ... that is to say ... well,
it really will not do for you to remain here!..."</p>

<p>"You mean, she is putting me out of the house!"
exclaimed Nacha, with indignation.</p>

<p>"Ah!... You understand.... Yes, you understand&mdash;precisely!..."</p>

<p>"Very well, I shall go today. Now be so kind
as to leave me."</p>

<p>The priest made a well rounded bow, and went
out. Scarcely had he set foot in the hall than he
returned, for he had heard Nacha calling him.</p>

<p>"You wish...?"</p>

<p>Nacha had for a moment thought of throwing
more light on the "crystal pure" virtue to which the
priest had alluded. She would have enjoyed the
relief of striking out once at least at the perversity
and hypocrisy her landlady represented....</p>

<p>"What is it, señorita?"</p>

<p>But Nacha suddenly felt that such vengeance was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
a small piece of business. No, it was not in her to
be petty in this fashion! Let this woman put her
out on the street; let her tell her priests what Nacha
had told her in confidence in order to console her;
let her do what she would! She, at least, Nacha
Regules, could not betray to anyone what she had
promised never to reveal!</p>

<p>"Nothing, Father! Leave me, please!"</p>

<p>She went to her room, dressed as carefully as the
day before, and went out to the street. There she
took a passing taxi, giving the chauffeur the address
of a boarding house in Lavalle Street. She would
never be asked if her past life had been "exemplary"
before being admitted to lodge in this house!</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>Mme. Annette's house, facing a well-known
park, was the most aristocratic of its kind in
all Buenos Aires. It was a resort of millionaires,
prominent politicians, and representatives of the
city's best families. At times half the cabinet was
to be found there, not, of course, assembled in
council. Public report had it that when the Chamber
of Deputies lacked a quorum, it was customary
to telephone to Mme. Annette's; and never had this
measure, unparliamentary though it might be, failed
to produce satisfactory results. At the very entrance
one began to breathe an air of luxury; then one
stepped into a world of silks, embroideries, gilt
furniture, rich rugs, and heavy hangings. A persistent
aroma of rose water was wafted through
the rooms, where a subdued, mysterious, light invited
to low-voiced conversation.</p>

<p>Nacha was waiting in a small inner reception
room. A woman, whom she did not know, was also
sitting there; "Madame" had left them for a moment
to receive a caller. Suddenly a familiar figure
appeared in the doorway. "Amelia!" Nacha, with
an exclamation of surprise, ran to meet her friend,
and kissed her.</p>

<p>"You here! Why, didn't you get married?"
She lowered her voice at the question. Amelia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
might feel ashamed in the presence of the strange
woman....</p>

<p>"Yes, I got married.... But ... here I am
just the same!"</p>

<p>She talked in a very loud voice, laughed boldly,
and emphasized whatever she had to say with graceful
movements of her snake-like body and her long
thin arms. She was dressed in a somewhat fantastic
and exuberant fashion, not without elegance. A
strong scent of violets pervaded the atmosphere
about her.</p>

<p>"I should worry!" she continued; "Listen, little
one. I'll admit that when I got married I had some
idea of living respectably. That's the truth. You
can say what you like. But you don't know what
I married. He used to work when he was a bachelor&mdash;in
a dry goods store. But after we were married
he left his job, and wanted to live on me&mdash;thought
I could go right on doing what I did before.
Well, this is what I said to him: I said, "All right.
I'll go back to the old life; but feed you with the
money I earn? Not much! So here I am. How
do I look? Not getting old very fast, eh?"</p>

<p>"You look splendid, Amelia, and more attractive
than ever. What a figure you have!"</p>

<p>"It isn't so bad, is it? But it's wasted on the old
fogies who come here. It makes you tired. Say,
do you remember the wild times we had, Nacha,
when we were just kids, and I called myself an
anarchist, and said everybody ought to have one
good fling at life?"</p>

<p>"And aren't you an anarchist now?"</p>

<p>"Me? You're crazy, little one. No more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
those fool ideas for me. Listen, I'm convinced now
that we girls of the profession are one of the strongest
pillars of society...."</p>

<p>She flung this out in ringing tones; and then, at
Nacha's horrified expression, burst out laughing,
throwing herself over to one side of her chair with
the sensuous grace and calm indifference of a cat.</p>

<p>Madame's arrival interrupted this conversation.
When she saw Amelia she greeted her with flattering
warmth, and immediately left the room with her.
The stranger looked at Nacha and seemed about
to speak. But Nacha was lost in wonderment over
all the things that may drive a woman to her ruin.
Amelia was frankness itself, and if she said she had
married with the hope of leading a decent life, it
must be true; so then it was her husband, on whom
she had built all her hopes of decency, who had
thrust her back into vice!</p>

<p>She was interrupted in her thoughts by the entrance
of a very young girl, at whom Nacha gazed,
charmed and astonished by the grace, and innocent
expression, of this delightful little person. She
could not take her eyes away from her; the girl,
answering her shy smile, asked, simply,</p>

<p>"What's your name? You look so good!"</p>

<p>"I'm not good, but I should like to be!"</p>

<p>The child&mdash;she seemed no older&mdash;sat down beside
Nacha, and began to talk with her. Although
she was actually seventeen, her slight, almost frail,
figure made her seem barely fourteen or fifteen.
Nacha was horrified by this little creature's presence
in that place. Didn't her parents know where
she was? And how could Mme. Annette let her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
come there? And the men, those respectable gentlemen
who were such good friends of Madame's,
how could they fail to utter a word of protest or
of pity? No, she could not understand the world;
for it despised her and all women like her, insulted
her and pushed her towards crime and every form
of misery; yet she was capable of feeling pity for
the girl at her side; and she knew many women of
her sort who would not have allowed a horror such
as this child's presence there, to be committed. She
wanted to ask this young thing to tell her how she
came to be in such a place, but she hesitated. The
other woman's presence embarrassed her.</p>

<p>"Tell me," Nacha whispered, taking the girl's
hand. "Why is it&mdash;how does it happen that&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The child raised her clear innocent eyes to
Nacha's, in wonder.</p>

<p>"Why do you come to this house?" Nacha asked
finally, blushing for her curiosity.</p>

<p>The girl raised troubled eyes to Nacha; then she
replied quite simply, without the slightest suggestion
of reproach toward anyone in her voice:</p>

<p>"My aunt sends me."</p>

<p>"And how long have you been coming here?"</p>

<p>"Two months."</p>

<p>"And before that&mdash;you had a sweetheart? Who
deceived you?"</p>

<p>"No, I never had a sweetheart. My aunt made
me come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't believe it! So this is what life has become
for you! Why, you ought to be out playing with
other children.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Nacha could scarcely breathe for indignation.
Then little by little, she brought out the child's
story.</p>

<p>About eight years before, the girl's aunt had visited
her parents, who were Spanish and lived in
great poverty in La Coruña. This aunt was rich,
and owned a store in Buenos Aires. Her little niece
attracted her; and as the child's parents had ten
other children, they gave her up to what seemed to
them a prosperous future. Her aunt took her back
with her, always treated her kindly; but the store
no longer prospered, and finally, she was forced
to close it. She told her little niece one day that
they were so poor she would have to earn some
money.</p>

<p>"We hadn't anything to eat," the child went on.
"I didn't see what my aunt could do. And I didn't
know what the place was she was sending me to.
So I came, as she told me. But when I went home
I cried, and said to my aunt I couldn't come to this
house any more.... My aunt begged me to be
brave, and told me that she was responsible for
everything. But&mdash;it seemed so bad to me! I felt
everything was all wrong. But my aunt says that
when people do what they are forced to do, they
are not really bad.... Can that be true? Tell
me what you think?"</p>

<p>Nacha overwhelmed with horror, did not know
what to reply.</p>

<p>"And is it wrong?"</p>

<p>Mme. Annette came in at this point and took the
girl away with her. Nacha got up from her chair
and rushed after them; but from the threshold of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the room into which Madame had swept, she caught
sight of a man and stopped short. Then she came
back to the strange woman, towards whom, until
this moment, she had felt a slight hostility.</p>

<p>"What a shame that is!" she broke out. "I have
never in my life heard anything like that child's
story. Exploited by her own aunt!"</p>

<p>"Don't be so angry," said the woman gently, as
Nacha, beside herself with indignation, sat down.</p>

<p>"It's no good complaining. I have seen so many
awful things that nothing shocks me, absolutely
nothing!"</p>

<p>Her words were correct but had a foreign accent.
She was neither pretty nor well dressed; but she
had marvellous blue eyes, and looked intelligent.
Nacha, who until then had scarcely noticed her, now
felt strongly attracted to her; and as they waited
there they talked with increasing confidence to one
another. Nacha learned that she was of a respected
and well-known family of a town in northern France,
and that she had come to South America under contract
to give some concerts. But the theatres in
which her manager required her to sing were of
such a kind&mdash;the Royal, for instance&mdash;that she refused.
She had, however, no resources, so finally
she made terms with the company, and was taken
to a "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pension d'artistes</i>," at which she was expected
to live. She soon found out what sort of a "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pensión</i>"
it was, and rebelled against the conditions of
life there. After leaving the place abruptly, she
tried to earn a living by working in an art shop.
The usual temptations followed. Then came a love
affair with one of its patrons: it ended badly....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>She smiled ironically as she looked at the tangled
skein of her memories.</p>

<p>"When I think of my parents," she continued, "I
am very unhappy. I would give my life to see them&mdash;but
it costs so much to go to Europe!"</p>

<p>Madame came bustling in.</p>

<p>"Nacha, will you come, please. I want to introduce
you to an old friend of the house&mdash;a good
friend. Let me see&mdash;are you well dressed? Your
stockings might be better. Next time do be careful
about your foot-wear."</p>

<p>Nacha was about to address her, but Madame
began again:</p>

<p>"Be a good girl, child. You're pretty enough&mdash;and
you have pretty manners, too, I know you have,
when you want to!"</p>

<p>Leaving Nacha under the august protection of
a venerable "father of his country," Madame took
up a position on the balcony of one of the rooms
facing the street, and began peering with great interest
through the branches of the trees in the park;
for it was time for her little daughter to come home
from the convent where she was being instructed
in all the virtues and accomplishments befitting a
young lady of the wealthy classes. And Madame
dreamed a little of this tender off-spring who, in a
few years, if all her schemes went well, would be
happily married, and highly respected; and she
would owe this happiness to her mother's skill in
managing a business that had no equal in Buenos
Aires;&mdash;on the champagne alone she made a hundred
pesos a day! Yes, "Madame" flattered herself
that she knew the value of institutions; with her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
talent for managing, her tact, and her French ways,
she had succeeded in accumulating a large fortune&mdash;thanks
to the support and approval of Politics,
Finance and Aristocracy!</p>

<p>A commotion behind her interrupted her reveries.
She turned and saw the worthy senator, now sputtering
with rage. His story was soon told. With
a flounce "Madame" hurried out to find Nacha
who had fled to the little reception room, empty
now, where she was standing in front of a mirror,
arranging the disorder of her hair.</p>

<p>"Nacha, what does this mean? Do you want
to ruin the reputation of my house?"</p>

<p>"No, Madame. But I've had enough of it."</p>

<p>"You're a fool! You're old enough to have got
rid of your silly notions."</p>

<p>Nacha's cheeks turned a flaming red and her
eyes shone with anger as she screamed at Madame:</p>

<p>"Don't you dare say a word to me or I'll get the
police! What do you mean by taking a child of
seventeen into this house? You miserable old
woman!"</p>

<p>"So you're going for the police are you? Well,
it happens that the police take their orders from
me! So don't waste your time telling them tales
about this house. I never ruined any woman! You
and your like ruin yourselves, because you want to,
because you take to vice like ducks to water, because
you are...."</p>

<p>But it was little use for "Madame" to wear herself
out screaming and running after Nacha; for
Nacha, with her hands over her ears, refused to
hear, which enraged "Madame" all the more. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
girl was running through the rooms, slamming
doors, and shrieking out words certain to be offensive
to "Madame's" professional dignity. In this
fashion, Nacha in the lead, and "Madame" after
her, they reached the stairway, down which Nacha
passed light as a breeze. As she opened the sumptuous
glass entrance door, and saw "Madame" at the
top of the stairs, she stuck out her tongue at her
qualifying the dignified lady's trade with certain
terms which even her long experience had not prepared
her to hear with equanimity.</p>

<p>"You old criminal!"</p>

<p>"Get out of here, viper!"</p>

<p>The door slammed, and Nacha jumped into a
cab and drove home. Scarcely had she reached
her room when she took off her hat and threw herself
down on her bed, weeping convulsively. Her
whole body was shaking with a nervous chill. She
tried to muffle the sounds of her weeping, but could
not. A girl who occupied the room next to hers,
came in, greatly alarmed. Should she send for the
doctor?&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just leave me alone, I want to be alone...."</p>

<p>"Are you angry with me?" asked the girl gently.
She was a plump little person with black eyes and
dark, soft skin, and was called Julieta.</p>

<p>Nacha, suddenly yielding to the girl's gentleness,
sat up and kissed her; but she could not check her
sobs and asked again to be left alone.</p>

<p>"And what about the doctor?" asked Julieta.
"You had better have him. You are not well."</p>

<p>"All right. Get him!..."</p>

<p>Nacha turned toward the wall, still weeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening the doctor arrived. Nacha who
had not eaten anything was still lying on her bed,
and still in her street clothes. The doctor declared
the attack to be entirely a matter of nerves and prescribed
rest and quiet.</p>

<p>The succession of shocks she had just lived
through; Mademoiselle's treachery; the loss of a
cherished illusion; the suppression in her of any
hope of leading a new life; worst of all, the effect of
her decision to return to her former mode of living,
had all been so many blows at her strength, physical
and moral.</p>

<p>In her sufferings and vacillations, nothing had
caused her so much torment as the thought of Monsalvat.
Even worse than the certainty that her life
was now definitely ruined, was the despair which
took possession of her whenever she thought of this
man.&mdash;She no longer doubted she loved him! His
image, always present to her eyes, had assumed
gigantic proportions in those moments when she
was committing acts that were fatal to all her hopes.
As she entered that house of evil it seemed to her
that Monsalvat's spirit was waiting there on the
stairs, trying to prevent her from passing. She had
closed her eyes, and lowered her head, and she had
walked straight through the shadowy figure that
was trying to save her.... But, all the time she
was there, he haunted her. The slightest noise made
her think he was coming into the room. A voice
in the corridor made her start for fear it was his
voice. Once she had even thought she saw him
pass by the open door....</p>

<p>Where was he now? she wondered. Why did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
he not look for her? Couldn't he guess how much
she needed his protection? Without it she could
not help but fall from depth to depth of degradation.
Why had not Monsalvat appeared in that
house of vice as she so desperately hoped, to rescue
her? Why didn't he come now to free her from
all this suffering?</p>

<p>Then she remembered that Monsalvat had told
her, on the one occasion when they had talked together,
that she ought to suffer&mdash;only so could she
deserve pardon and pity. Those were his words....
She brooded over them. Nothing else gave
any meaning to her miserable existence. She would
welcome suffering then, and resign herself to grief!
A little quieted, she went to sleep.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>September! Springtime! Buenos Aires with
all the handsome trees of its avenues, its parks
and open squares, and of its wide promenades along
the river bank, was turning green as if by magic,
offering to the delighted eye every conceivable shade
of verdure. It was as though the hand of a great
and invisible artist were retouching the somewhat
faded picture Winter had turned over to him. He
crushed under his swift brush the emerald of English
lawns, spattered canary yellow on the shoots
of young shrubs, with an impatient stroke of the
knife scraped from the leaf fronds their velvety
coverings of dull blue, burnt sienna and fawn, in
order to freshen them up with aurora yellow, sepia,
cobalt; poured out on the great parks all the chromes
of his cosmic palate; rejuvenated the willows with
ingenious splashes of those gamboge shades which
remind one of fantastic tropical climes; and turned
high noon into a glittering dream of gold. Oh,
Springtime in Buenos Aires! Season of awakening
grace and enchanting harmony, with nothing of the
torpor of hot climates, the over-vivid colorings of
the tropics, nor of the sluggishness of those lands
where nature puts human energy to sleep through
a long winter! Springtime in Buenos Aires! The
air quivers with a dust of gold, which seems to float
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
down from the brilliant sky, emanate from the trees,
the flowers, and the grass, enveloping the buildings
and transfiguring the human beings who pass
through it. Springtime in Buenos Aires!</p>

<p>But for Monsalvat the spring was a season of
sadness. To him the light and color and sounds
of the reinvigorated city were meaningless. He
noticed neither the satisfaction of the plants and
grasses in the stir of life within them, nor the delight
shining in the faces about him. He was alone
in the Universe, a stranger to the world he lived
in, for that world was now his enemy; a stranger
also, through birth and station, to the world of
those who are down-trodden, and oppressed. His
mother dead, his sister lost, and that other woman
in whom his new life had taken form, as yet unfound,
he was alone. The friends of former times
laughed at his ideas and ideals, said he had a new
"pose," thought him crazy. What could he discuss
with them except the trivial events of the social
farce? They neither understood him nor wished
to understand. He was utterly and irrevocably
alone. If some one chanced to mention the beauty
of the day, he answered&mdash;but to himself&mdash;"What
is that to me?" What is there beyond our own sensations?
Does even the material world exist save
as our senses make us aware of it? And his sensations
told him that there was nothing but sadness,
grief, loneliness and gloom in all the human beings
around him. The world was his own unhappy
creation, the work of his agonized spirit. No, that
Springtide was for him a time of bitterness.</p>

<p>All the while Nacha, with her somewhat ingenuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
aspirations to a new kind of life was hiding
at Mlle. Dupont's, Monsalvat had been searching
for her. With Torres, he had sought her at Mme.
Annette's toward the beginning of September, about
a month before Nacha had gone there. He had
been also to the house of Juanita Sanmartino, and
the more recent disappointment of not finding Nacha
there filled him with gloomy foreboding. Where
was she? No one knew. Torres was certain she
had not returned to her former means of livelihood;
for in that case she would have appeared at one
of these houses. It was Torres' theory that she
was living with someone, perhaps some former
friend, perhaps a recent chance acquaintance.</p>

<p>And Eugenia Monsalvat? No one could give
him any clue to her whereabouts either. Had she
changed her name? Was she dead? Or dragging
out a wretched existence in the big city's underworld?</p>

<p>Towards the end of September, an appointment
as second chief of staff in a department of the
Ministry of Foreign Relations came to distract
Monsalvat from his obsession of loneliness and
failure. He began now to spend all his afternoons
working at the Ministry. Some of his colleagues,
who had heard the rumors current about Monsalvat's
opinions and eccentricities, tried to make him
talk, to force him to commit himself; but he maintained
his reserve, and skillfully turned aside the
indiscreet insinuations aimed at him.</p>

<p>On a certain morning of this same month, Monsalvat
betook himself to his mother's former lodgings,
for he thought it time to call upon the Morenos.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Since the morning when he had suspected that Irene
was in danger of falling in love with him, he had
avoided seeing her. What might such a feeling on
her part lead to? Yet, free as he was from other entanglements
why should he not accept the affection
of this pretty and passionate girl? She was experienced
enough to know what she was doing&mdash;there
would be no deception.... In his solitude, with no
friend on all the wide horizon of his life, why run
away from Irene?... But there was Nacha....
What though his search had been useless, and he
had no news of her, nor any kind of assurance that
she ever thought of him? No; he could not, now,
permit himself to love another woman. He was
bound as by a vow. Was he then in love with
Nacha? One whole week he fought out the answer;
called himself ridiculous, despised himself, tried to
detach his thoughts from everything which might
draw him towards her; it was of no avail. On the
contrary, the more he thought of her the more he
longed to find her. But he had not forgotten Irene.
He did not go to see her; but he sent her money in
amounts which to her family seemed enormous.
Irene wrote to thank him and asked to be allowed
to see him in his rooms if he would not come to
call on her.</p>

<p>On this September afternoon Monsalvat found
the entire Moreno family at home, to his relief;
for he did not want to be alone with Irene.</p>

<p>"My Protector," exclaimed Moreno, at sight of
him, "my Doctor, Savior of my accursed tribe, Light
of Legal Science! Model of Generosity!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat protested at these eulogies and tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
to escape from Moreno's determined embrace. His
wife was laughing at her husband, and at the same
time, crying, as she kissed Monsalvat's hand and
pointed to the children.</p>

<p>"We cannot permit such modesty, Doctor. We
are yours, entirely yours. To think that the whole
Moreno family, and Moreno himself ... <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Quantum
mutatus ab illo!</i> as Cicero said. You see I do
not forget my Latin! Culture, Doctor! I was a
man of law once, I lived among books and historic
cases&mdash;and now I am a pauper, a drunkard,
a...."</p>

<p>Irene, standing in a corner of the room, covered
her face, ashamed. From the moment Monsalvat
had come into the room she had not moved, waiting
for the avalanche of thanks she had foreseen, to
pass. Monsalvat, as embarrassed as she by Moreno's
words, finally made his way through the huddling
children and held out his hand to her.</p>

<p>"The flower of my house!" exclaimed Moreno,
adding in a melancholy tone, "Ah, if we were not
so poor, I would give her to no one but a Prince&mdash;or&mdash;pardon
me&mdash;to a Dr. Monsalvat, who is like
a prince; for he is a Prince of Jurisprudence...."</p>

<p>Neither Monsalvat nor Irene were listening.
Monsalvat had started when he felt Irene's burning
hand in his, and saw her eyes, darkened with
the passion that consumed her. He looked at her
a moment and, not knowing what to say, turned to
address Moreno's fawning flattery. Monsalvat then
took leave, saying he had come especially to learn if
Irene had some news for him.</p>

<p>"I am going to tell it to you. Come!" Irene
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
replied with a strange burst of energy; and she
faced him with flashing eyes and quivering lips.</p>

<p>Monsalvat shook hands with her parents and followed
to the narrow hallway which led to the stairs.
Moreno was coming along too but Irene told him
to stay with her mother.</p>

<p>"She gives the orders! Now you see, Doctor,
what has become of my paternal authority. I'm
just the watch-dog. I hear and obey, for fear of
the whip! When your career is over, that's what
you get! My dear doctor, I am your servant!"
Monsalvat followed Irene down the dark hall for
a few yards. They came closer to one another, his
clothing touched hers. He was conscious of the
girl's burning passion, he felt himself being drawn
towards her. In the semi-darkness Irene's brilliant
eyes gleamed strangely.</p>

<p>"Well, what news?" asked Monsalvat uneasily.</p>

<p>"News!" Irene with quick violence pulled Monsalvat's
face toward hers and placed on his mouth
her hot, trembling lips.</p>

<p>He turned faint. His will abandoned him. He
heard the wild, mad words Irene was saying. "He
must take her away!" She pressed her trembling
body close to his. Suddenly Monsalvat came to
himself. Nacha's image arose before his eyes....
With a strength which came from the depths of his
soul he pushed Irene away from him. This poor
passionate girl was threatening his ideal. All that
he had so far accomplished was in danger of crumbling
to dust. The only justification of his life
would, with a moment's weakness, be lost. He said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
good-bye to her, asked her to forgive him and walked
quietly toward the stairs.</p>

<p>"Don't leave me this way," she cried. "If I can't
work for you, live for you, I shall die, I shall kill
myself ... if you won't take me with you!"</p>

<p>But Monsalvat did not hear. He was already in
the street.</p>

<p>Irene, shaken by violent shudders and sobs, with
a wild cry, threw herself against the wall.</p>

<p>After this episode he was more eager than ever
to find Nacha. He began to make the rounds of
cabarets, restaurants, and theatres. But day after
day passed, and there was not the slightest news of
her. He began to despair when it occurred to him
that the streets might furnish him the information
he so anxiously sought. He became a vagabond,
roaming about hour after hour, morning, afternoon,
and night. The avenues in the centre of the city,
those where women of pleasure passed, came to
know him. He thought he saw Nacha, quickened
his step, followed the woman. It was not she. He
sought her face in the crowds that all morning wander
idly up and down the <em>Avenida Florida</em>. He
sought it in the throngs loitering on the wide promenade
when the lights of the shop windows drive
back the shadows of the high buildings. He sought
her among the young and pretty women who surreptitiously
pass up and down the avenue, in quest
of bread, love, pleasure. He sought her at night
in the streets leading toward the theatres, the movies,
the cabarets. And his shadow passing up and
down these places was no different from that of a
man timidly seeking a daughter of joy. The thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
noises of the street, the cries of newspaper
venders, automobile horns, street-car gongs, phonographs
playing in the shops, the persistent scraping
of shoe leather on the sidewalk, the voices of the
toy venders, of the sellers of lottery tickets, of the
flower girls, rang out in the strange chaotic symphony
of the city. But he was deaf to it all. Lights
glittered, electric street-signs flashed; blue, red,
green, yellow lamps shone out from windows, sometimes
far above the street; but he went by unaware
of all this nightly brilliancy. The show windows
tempted with jewels, flowers, books; he was blind
to them. He went on, heedless of the marvelous
spectacle offered by the streets of cosmopolitan exuberant,
noisy, energetic, restless Buenos Aires. He
was incapable of seeing anything but the face he
sought: Nacha's face.</p>

<p>And while he searched for Nacha, he searched
the streets for his sister also. But not with the same
eagerness. For Eugenia, whom he scarcely knew,
he had never had much affection. Besides, there was
so little hope of finding her in this fashion! In
the ten years that had passed since he had seen her,
the transformation of an innocent twenty year old
girl into a courtesan must have been thoroughly
accomplished. How could he recognize her even
if he met her? He wanted to come upon her and
help her, yes;&mdash;but from sense of duty; and because
of his mother's last wish.</p>

<p>October now. A month and a half had passed in
useless searching. Discouraged, he thought of giving
up all hope, and returning to his former way of
life, since he had failed in his first duty, that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
finding Nacha. He tried to discover arguments to
justify his abandoning what he called his "duty."
What was Nacha after all? Well then&mdash;was he
going to fall in love with that kind of a woman,
and make her represent an ideal, a duty, a reason
for living? Had he brought ruin upon her? Why
did he want to see her?</p>

<p>He began to think that he would never find her,
that she was irrecoverably lost. And it was his
fault! It was he who had gone to see her, tried
to influence her, caused trouble between her and
her lover. It was only just that he should help her
to regain her moral independence, the right she
shared with every human being to hope and to love.
He could not let her continue in slavery, any more
than he could allow any other human beings whom
he, personally, knew, to remain enslaved! But he
hoped also, in saving her, to save himself. It was
not exploitation by others that threatened him, but
his own coldness of fear, and the uselessness of his
empty life. He wanted to free himself from the
clutch of vanity, from the all-enveloping net of human
selfishness. He must accomplish something
good and great! To redeem the slaves of degrading
labor, of destructive passion, of vice and greed,
there was a man's task. Well, the opportunity for
that might come....</p>

<p>But meanwhile there was a girl who was unhappy,
who needed his help. Would it be such a
small thing to save her? He could imagine himself
quite content were that accomplished. Suddenly
hope sprang up in the midst of his discouragement.
If his tenants refused to allow the improvements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
he had wanted to make in the tenement, he would
use the forty thousand <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> of his mortgage in
carrying on a thorough search of the city. Surely
Nacha would be found! Before long, however, he
had to part with a considerable sum to pay off his
mother's debts; and to buy from Celedonia some
letters of Eugenia's which the mulatto intimated
she could profitably sell to the newspapers. Monsalvat
had an uneasy feeling that this procedure of
hers had been suggested by that enthusiastic admirer
of his, Moreno.</p>

<p>One October afternoon Torres, whom he met on
the street, exclaimed, "I have some news. Nacha
has gone back to the profession. A few days ago
she was at Madame Annette's." This was a blow
as well as a relief. But his friend's words seemed
to summon Nacha from the air. All that afternoon,
all night, all the next day, and the days following,
Nacha was with him, and in the midst of intense
suffering he felt a new, strange joy....</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>During the ten days when Nacha lay ill in bed
her story reached the ears of everyone in the
boarding house and aroused general interest. The
girls of this calling, who are not yet hardened by
cynicism and despair, are for the most part sentimental,
even romantic, and invariably sympathize
with the hero or the heroine, as the case may be,
of a moving love story. Nacha was reported to
be suffering from a passion for a man who had
spoken to her only once; it was asserted also that
she knew neither who he was, nor where he came
from; but the fact that she must needs be unfaithful
to this platonic and strange love, could not fail to
arouse the liveliest sympathy among all these girls.
They pitied her from their hearts, and considered
it quite natural that she should be ill under the
circumstances. When a girl loved a man as much
as this, it was a shame that she should have to live
as Nacha was living! What did this man look like,
they wondered, and what could he and Nacha have
talked about in that one fatal conversation? Then
from trying to imagine what this love story must
have been, they began to recall others in which they
had played a part. But none of them was like
Nacha's which, they agreed, surpassed even the
"daily love stories" of the newspapers. And they
envied Nacha, and hoped for an experience like hers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
even though, like her, they might have to suffer
hunger and sickness.</p>

<p>The owner of the house, Doña Lucía, was a silent
little old woman. She kept two rooms, spotlessly
clean, and entirely unattractive, for her own use.
She never ate with her boarders and was too timid
to call on them in their rooms or make any advances
to them. Of a good provincial family, she concealed
her name, for she thought it discreditable
to have such lodgers in her house. Her family was
little known in Buenos Aires, and as a matter of
fact, she had little affection for any of its members;
nevertheless she had a superstitious respect for
"good blood" and would have suffered anything
rather than disgrace an old name. Poor and alone,
forgotten by her relatives, this widow of an officer
who had died insane, had taken up her quarters in a
boarding house kept by a friend. Even then lodgers
of doubtful respectability were frequenting it. Doña
Lucía was aware of this fact but never dared mention
it to her friend, and when the latter died, she
kept the house going. She had resolved to take in
no one without references, but she was too timid
to insist on this point. Moreover she always found
it hard not to believe what she was told. After
awhile she grew accustomed to the class of boarders
who sought her house; and the girls had a genuine
respect for this old lady who went to church so often,
and looked so severe.</p>

<p>When Nacha was well enough to get up, she went
to call on Doña Lucía, to thank her for kind attentions
such as goblets of port wine, and the paying
of her medicines at the drug store during her illness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Doña Lucía revealed that all this had been done at
the expense of three of the lodgers, Julieta, Sara
and Ana María. These girls barely knew her and
Nacha was touched by their generosity. She was
well aware that Sara earned little having recently
had difficulties with the police; Julieta was a quiet
little person who made barely enough to live on,
and Ana María's own bad health required a considerable
expenditure for medicines. Their care of
Nacha must have been at the cost of their own
necessities.</p>

<p>Nacha could not but admit that she would have
done as much for Julieta and Sara, who were already
her friends; but it surprised her very much that Ana
María should have shared in this expense. Ana
María had visited her only twice during her illness.
The first time she had come in with Julieta, and
Nacha had been disagreeably affected by her presence.
She was painfully emaciated, her cheeks
sunken and yellow and her wide eyes looked frightened.
Nacha decided she must be consumptive.
She noted that her features were fine, of an aristocratic
caste. During that first visit Nacha could
not keep from staring at Ana María's wasted form,
her prominent shoulder blades, her sunken chest,
the transparent skin of her hands. The girl spoke
slowly and there was in her voice a haunting melancholy.
No one knew much about her. She claimed
that her name was Ana María Gonzalez, but offered
nothing to prove it. She seemed destitute of plans,
of desire to live, of interests. Julieta had heard,
from a friend, that Ana María had once possessed
every luxury. A success in the "profession," she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
had owned a fine house, plenty of money, her own
automobile; but quite recently, and very suddenly
had come the decay of fortune and health. There
was something mysterious about her which excited
Nacha's curiosity. The second time she saw her,
Nacha was alone in her room. Ana María, staring
at her with her wide strange eyes, questioned her
about her life. Nacha's answer appeared to interest
her but little; indeed, she seemed at times not
to be listening. When Nacha began to talk about
Monsalvat, however, Ana María suddenly became
all attention. She seemed to be absorbing this part
of the story with all her senses, with all her soul;
yet, when Nacha had ended, she left the room without
a word.</p>

<p>Since that afternoon Nacha had not seen her, but
she spoke of her to Julieta and Sara. Julieta, plump
and gentle, with velvety eyes and red lips, still retained
a great deal of girlish modesty. She cherished
the dream that a grand passion would come
to her rescue. At times she became melancholy,
even pessimistic, but she did not yet count herself
among the lost. One result of this was that the
other girls considered her "respectable." Among
these others was Sara, who had all the appearance
of having fallen very low indeed, yet she had led
this life scarcely a year. Vice had, however, set
its mark on her. She liked coarse stories, and obscene
words. When, in the dining-room, some one
of the men living in the house told a questionable
anecdote, Sara never failed to respond with something
worse. She was tall, thin, quick of movement
with long arms and legs. Her face was sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
pretty, but it was her mouth people noticed; a mouth
that was large, the lips mobile, and curving slightly
upward, red as pomegranates, and moist. When
talking, she moved her head constantly, gesticulating
with her long arms. She rarely sat still, preferring
to walk up and down, and she could not say a sentence
without covering a distance of two or three
yards, lifting her feet as though about to execute
a dance step, laughing and opening her mouth wide
so that one could see her long uneven teeth. There
was not the slightest reserve nor modesty about her
and she sought her patrons in the street with an
indifference to appearances which distressed Julieta.
Sara seemed oddly unaware of her situation, and of
the difference between her and decent women. As
to men, they were all the same to her. She liked
them all, and never attempted to claim any one of
them. Doña Lucía could not bear her and would
have put her out had she dared, for Sara and her
friends, when they were in a merry mood, would
sing, talk loud, and burst into roars of laughter, all
to the great distress of Doña Lucía, who implored
the saints to free her from this disgraceful boarder.
Sara's one fear was the police. She had only lately
been arrested on the street and since then had become
very cautious. Ana María gave every evidence
of thoroughly disliking her; and several times
when Sara indulged in coarse speeches, she had left
the table. This always seemed a good joke to Sara,
who, between bursts of laughter, would call Ana
María "Madame Pompadour," though no one knew
where she found this name, nor why she applied it
to Ana María.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ana María must be half crazy," Nacha was
saying. "I am afraid of her."</p>

<p>"You needn't be," Julieta replied. "She suffers
a good deal. Nobody knows what she's been
through before coming to this. I'm sorry for her.
The poor girl has a kind heart."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course!" exclaimed Sara, with a laugh,
walking up and down in the room. "You always
think they have 'kind hearts.' I think she's got a
lot of silly pride. She thinks herself better than the
rest of us."</p>

<p>"Well, isn't she?" asked Julieta.</p>

<p>Nacha, now almost well, dreaded the moment of
complete recovery. That moment would exact her
return to what she hated. She would have given
years from her life to be able to live as a decent
girl. Moreover she was afraid of having another
attack of illness if she could not have the decency
she craved. But it was neither for fear of illness,
nor love of decency that she wanted to keep
"straight." It was for Monsalvat, who was in her
thoughts night and day, whether she slept or lay
awake, when she talked with her companions, and
when she read, alone in her room.</p>

<p>One afternoon when Julieta came in Nacha said
to her, "I want to be good&mdash;on his account, you see,
Julieta. I'd do anything, work in a store, or whatever
comes along. Do you think there's any chance&mdash;of
my being what I ought to be?"</p>

<p>Julieta, who had been listening with a woeful
expression in her dark eyes, smiled gently, and
caressed Nacha's hand, but she did not look at her
friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you answer me? Do you think it
impossible that I&mdash;that any woman&mdash;for love, and
thinking all the time of him...? Is it impossible?
Tell me the truth. If you don't tell me what you
really think you're not my friend. Is it possible?
Answer me!"</p>

<p>"It would be if it depended only on us. But
people make it so hard for us! They don't want
us to be good, Nacha!"</p>

<p>Both girls knew how true that was, and remained
silent a long time, saddened, hurt, looking at one
another like little children who have lost their
mother.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Nacha determined to make one
more attempt to save herself. She would find Monsalvat.
She would seek him to the ends of the
earth! So she began questioning the two students
who lived in the house, a pair of lazy rascals, who
took small interest in anything beyond their immediate
horizon. One of them, Grajera, a short dark
youth, as ugly as he was talkative, a chronic law-student,
dissipated, incapable of telling the truth,
had tried every makeshift for raising money. He
had taught the art of skating, delivered lectures on
tuberculosis, acted in cheap theatres, written articles
for small town newspapers, and invented a system
for never paying hotel or boarding house bills.
Nacha had known him years ago in her mother's
boarding house, and, because Grajera had made
Riga's acquaintance there, was on friendly terms
with him. He was besides an amusing table companion.
Nacha implored him to find out where
Monsalvat lived, and Grajera willingly promised to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
do so. The only trouble was that he always forgot
to attend to this commission.</p>

<p>The other youth, also nominally a student, although
it would have been hard to discover of what,
was of a family from Córdoba, the son of a well-known
judge, whose death after a laborious and austere
life, had been generally lamented. Panchito, who
had been sent away from home on account of early
misbehavior, returned to Córdoba after his father's
death, but was now once more in Buenos Aires, incorrigible
as ever, always on the lookout for a
chance to play a trick to his advantage, always running
after women and always lying to everybody.
Nacha asked him also to try to discover Monsalvat's
whereabouts; but Panchito never thought about anything
except the next races, handicaps, betting favorites
and other topics of the turf. He always jotted
down in a note book the wind velocity, the weight
of each horse, the condition of the track, and other
highly significant details. Yet, notwithstanding all
this care, and the scientific accuracy of the data on
which Panchito based his calculations, he invariably
lost.</p>

<p>When she saw that her friends were not going
to help her much, Nacha had recourse to a woman
who told fortunes from cards. She had been recommended
by Sara, who asserted that she never failed
to foretell exactly what was going to happen. Nacha
sent for her, and watched breathlessly, in tense
excitement, while the dirty, yellow-skinned old sybil
prepared to read her fate from a greasy pack of
cards, which had been shuffled by Nacha, and cut
with her left hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"The ace of diamonds and the four of clubs mean
recovery from sickness. But here's the four of
hearts; that means successful love; completely successful;
because here's the two of hearts, do you see,
which means a proposal! Then&mdash;here's a dark
woman, and serious illness!"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's a woman. But there's nothing here
that means love. It's certainly a woman, Miss."</p>

<p>Nacha tried to find an interpretation that would
fit all of this. Could Monsalvat be ill? or in love
with another woman? Such an idea was unbearable.
Then she asked the question that was uppermost
in her mind. "Where did Monsalvat live?"</p>

<p>"Here's the king of hearts! That means a dark
man, of strong character, and generous."</p>

<p>"That's it, of course! Well, where is he?"</p>

<p>"This doesn't say. But here's the two of spades.
That means a letter, or news, or an arrival. Either
the dark man is going to write to you; or he is coming
here at any moment."</p>

<p>Nacha gladly paid the old woman the five <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i>
she charged for her services. This left her penniless,
but she was happy! Everything looked hopeful
now. Several times during the day she thought
Monsalvat was about to arrive on the scene. The
following day, she felt so certain that someone was
coming that she waited in the courtyard; and she
was immensely surprised when some newcomers
turned out to be a man and wife with their twelve
year old daughter, relatives of Panchito's, and just
landed from Córdoba. No sooner were they installed
in their rooms than there was a general rush
to Panchito's quarters for an explanation. Panchito,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
still half asleep, was forced to receive his
callers in bed. Grajera, in the bedroom opposite,
was snoring and Sara tried to rouse him with ticklings,
slaps, and cold water, until there was a general
protest. Meanwhile Panchito tried desperately to
piece together an explanation of his relatives' arrival
at his boarding house.</p>

<p>"Just like that donkey to come here," he was saying.
"I told him what kind of a house this was,
and what made him bring his family here, I don't
know! Oh, I've got it! I didn't see through it
before! This is some of my old woman's work,
that's what it is! Of course! I wrote her that I
was living in a very respectable house, with a highly
religious family, and that they made me go to confession
twice a month&mdash;and the old woman must
have repeated all this to that bumpkin uncle of mine
who lives out in the country, in Saint Joseph's Sleepy
Hollow&mdash;and he took it into his head to come
here...."</p>

<p>"Where did you say he lived?" inquired Sara,
her mouth open from ear to ear.</p>

<p>"Saint Joseph's Sleepy Hollow&mdash;a little village
over toward...."</p>

<p>But the name called forth a series of witticisms
at which Sara was nearly beside herself with mirth.
Panchito implored the girls to behave properly. He
didn't want his relatives to become aware of their
mistake if it could be prevented. Then he drove all
his visitors out, and went back to bed.</p>

<p>That afternoon Grajera and Panchito presented
themselves, in throes of laughter, at Nacha's door.
They had just beheld Sara reclining on a couch, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
long legs waving in the air, while she lent an obliging
ear to a detailed account of all the troubles,
sicknesses and operations of the lady from Córdoba,
who had evidently taken a great fancy to this sympathetic
listener.</p>

<p>Doña Lucía was delighted with her new boarders,
though somewhat astonished when they informed
her that they had selected her house because it had
been recommended to them for its atmosphere.
Doña Lucía could only nod and curtsey, and turn
every color of the rainbow. She perceived, however,
that her guests from Córdoba would require
her to set a good table; and, against her will, she
found herself forced to ask Nacha for her board.</p>

<p>This was what Nacha had been dreading. She
could not blame Doña Lucía, who was well within
her right. All night long she tried to devise some
means of escaping the inevitable. Should she try
a hand at a gambling table, buy a lottery ticket, ask
someone to lend her money...? But at two
o'clock the next day she put on her street clothes
and started off for the house of Signora Sanmartino,
avoiding Julieta's clear eyes as she did so;
for she was ashamed, not so much because of the
act itself as because of what it signified, the betrayal
of a feeling which had ennobled her and purified her
in the eyes of her companions.</p>

<p>Nacha knew Juanita Sanmartino of old. Although
Juanita was an Italian she might have been
Queen Victoria's own sister. The same complexion,
the same downward curving nose, the same odd and
rather ridiculous way of wearing her hair. Like
Mme. Annette, she had a daughter, and for her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
daughter's sake traded in the misfortunes of other
women. Her daughter, a pretty girl of fourteen,
lived in the house; and her pristine innocence seemed
quite untouched by her surroundings.</p>

<p>Nacha returned crushed. She paid for a few
days' board; then went to her room, and threw
herself on her bed, weeping.</p>

<p>Suddenly she felt a presence in the room and
sat up. More skeleton-like than ever, Ana María
stood looking at her. Nacha gave a little scream.
The girl tried to take her hand, but Nacha drew
away, shuddering, from the touch of her skin.</p>

<p>"Why ... are you afraid ... of me?"</p>

<p>Ana María's words struck her ear like a voice
from beyond the grave. It was growing dark; but
Nacha had not the courage to get up and turn on
the light, nor did she know what to reply. So she
waited, hoping Julieta would come in.</p>

<p>"Tell me again about Monsalvat," commanded
Ana María feverishly.</p>

<p>"I think he must have loved me very much, don't
you? Who else would have done what he did for
me? And yet sometimes I think it was not for me
at all, but for his sister who was betrayed, and who
is lost, as I am lost. I think he did for me what he
wanted to do for her."</p>

<p>Ana María's expression was very strange, her
eyes wild as though she saw something as ghastly
as death. Nacha, terrified, was about to cry out;
but Ana María sat silent, her wasted body scarcely
able any longer to hold the unhappy spirit that was
trying desperately to tear itself out of it. Finally
she stood up and went out of the room, but with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
an unsteady step, leaning on the articles of furniture
she passed. When Julieta and Sara came in,
Nacha told them about Ana María's unaccountable
behavior.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she knew Monsalvat. Perhaps he was
a lover of hers," suggested Sara.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Nacha, with a start. "I see what it
is. I see! His sister!"</p>

<p>Julieta rushed to the girl's room to discover if
this were true. She found Ana María lying on her
bed, motionless, apparently asleep. While Julieta
stood looking at her, she opened her eyes once or
twice but apparently saw nothing. Julieta spoke to
her, but received no reply. She knew this was all
very strange, but stood hesitating, not knowing what
to do, until Ana María grew restless and began to
murmur unintelligibly. Then Julieta called Sara
and Nacha. It occurred to them to give the sick
girl some brandy; but she grew worse, and began to
moan. Then she became delirious. They sent for
the doctor. The whole house was curious, now, to
see what was going on. Some of the boarders
crowded into the room, others stood around the
door asking questions. Doña Lucía, full of scruples,
did not venture to come in.</p>

<p>When the doctor arrived, Ana María was dying.
He was not long in discovering what had happened,
for a morphine syringe lay on the floor, and on the
table by the bed there was a bottle of the drug.</p>

<p>Julieta and Nacha searched through the dead
girl's belongings for a clue to her name; and they
soon came upon some old letters tied up in blue
ribbon. Almost everyone began "Dear Eugenia"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
and ended "Your brother" or "Fernando." Among
them were three photographs, one of an elderly
man, one of a woman, and one of Fernando Monsalvat.
Nacha took possession of this last. There
could no longer be any doubt. The unfortunate
morphine addict was Eugenia Monsalvat....</p>

<p>Nacha had never seen death at close hand before.
Obsessed by the scene she had just witnessed,
she imagined herself dying, forsaken by everyone
she knew. The horrible pictures Monsalvat had
painted of what lay in store for her rose threateningly
in her memory; and she was so terrified by
her imaginings that she could not bear to be alone
for a single moment, nor could she bring herself
to go to bed. Once when she tried to sleep fully
dressed, she awoke suddenly, uttering a shriek which
startled the entire household. In her dream she
had been locked in a coffin....</p>

<p>Panchito's aunt, and Doña Lucía set the room
in order, and performed the last services for poor
Ana María. Sara, whose custom it was to go out
to the streets every night after dinner, remained in
the room, silent, and full of grotesque fears. As
the women sat watching the dead girl one of them
began to pray, and the girls joined in, shaken and
weeping. The rough pine coffin, the two yellow
tapers, the tearful prayers for the unhappy creature
who had died in poverty, and far from any of her
kin, the grief of these other girls, who wept as if
repentent of all the tawdry weakness of their lives,
formed a scene impressive even to the three or four
men looking on. It seemed as though Ana María's
long days of suffering, and short hours of joy, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
caresses and her laughter, the goblets of champagne
that those dead hands had raised to then living lips,
and the soft silks that had once touched that cold
body, were transformed into tears now, blinding
the eyes of these girls, who wept for her past, for
her death, for her suffering, but above all, for her
despair.</p>

<p>At a certain moment, when the women began to
pray, the two students, empty-headed and irreligious
as they were, had the same impulse. They too
wished to offer something to the dead; and at precisely
the same moment, hastily, and each trying to
hide the gesture from the other, they crossed themselves.
At any other time this would have been the
occasion of ridicule; but now each turned away with
a smile that had in it more of pity than anything
else; for even they felt that there was in that room
something more than a tragic death; to cross ones-self
in the presence of these even more tragic lives
seemed indeed a small thing.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p>The doctor's words rang in Monsalvat's ear.</p>

<p>"Nacha has returned to the profession." How
ironical the phrase! Profession, in truth, but of
despair instead of faith in God, in law, in science!
Yet oddly enough, this very relapse of hers gave
him hope. He knew now where to look for her;
and at the thought his blood ran faster. The very
signs on the street corners spoke of finding her;
automobile horns, the cries of street venders, all
the incongruous voices of the enormous city, clamored
to him that soon he would find Nacha. When
his thoughts dwelt on all that was horrible, inhuman
and painful in the life the girl must at that very
moment be leading, his heart seemed to grow cold.
No, it was better not to think.... Yet, were it
not for these facts too horrible to think of, he might
never trace her!</p>

<p>So, with his friend the doctor, he began the search
for Nacha, and also for his sister, although his
recovery of Eugenia was now a secondary interest.
Together they started on a painful and long journey
through the circles of that living hell reserved for
fallen women, a martyrdom among other more
frightful martyrdoms. Yet these stages of his journey
led him through only the first circles of that
inferno; for it was in these first circles that he expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to find the two women he was seeking. There
are other circles more frightful and more tragic still.</p>

<p>With the doctor as his guide Monsalvat descended
into these regions. The entrance gate was Madame
Annette's front door; and upon it might very well
have been blazoned forth</p>

<p class="indent6">
"Through me you pass into the city of woe,<br />
Through me you pass into eternal pain,<br />
Through me among the people lost for aye!"<br />
</p>

<p>But, alas, these were not the only gates of hell!
Their number was infinite, and the women who
passed through returned no more. However, the
door of Mme. Annette's house was the principal
gate, the gate of gold!</p>

<p>"Nacha Regules?" the French woman repeated
coldly. "I don't know her."</p>

<p>The doctor persisted however in his inquiries, for
he had caught a false intonation in the woman's
denial. Mme. Annette kept to her first statement;
and as he watched her vulgar gestures and listened
to her displeasing voice, Monsalvat felt an indefinable
uneasiness. How could such a woman, disagreeable,
coarse, bad-tempered as she appeared,
have the patrons of the sort Torres asserted she
had? Surely crime lurked under the apparent luxury
of this place; and if this evil enchantress succeeded
in satisfying her aristocratic clients, it was
with morsels of delicate flesh obtained by the most
unspeakable deceptions and cruelties!</p>

<p>"Shall I call in the girls?" Mme. Annette asked
abruptly, mistrustful of her callers; for she scarcely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
knew Torres and she had noticed Monsalvat's
disgust.</p>

<p>"Let us go to the dining-room. Ask them to
have a glass of champagne with us," the doctor
replied.</p>

<p>Three of the girls came in. One of them was the
child with whom Nacha had made friends. Monsalvat
started at sight of this young thing. His
eyes flashed anger as he looked at Mme. Annette,
who lowered hers, more frightened than ashamed.
Torres called the child to him and she sat down
on the sofa beside him. Mme. Annette left her
callers for a moment while she went to prepare the
champagne. A fine-looking brunette, who declared
herself a Paraguayan, entered into conversation
with Monsalvat. Her eyes, indeed all her features,
and her manner of speaking, bore witness to not
very remote Indian ancestors. She knew nothing
of Nacha or Eugenia, had never heard of them.
Monsalvat, who thought every woman in this profession
must be the victim of hostile circumstances,
asked her to tell him her story. No doubt she
too had suffered at the hands of father, or lover,
or some exploiter of women! The girl, however,
protested that the life she was leading was
the only life for her. It meant pleasure, freedom,
money; she did not have to work and heard
nothing but pretty speeches from men. As she
spoke a savage sensuality played about her eyes
and lips. Obviously she loved pleasure for pleasure's
sake. While she praised her profession she
blew kisses into the air or pressed her arms tightly
against her breasts in a kind of ecstasy; and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
drank her champagne slowly, tasting its sweetness
to the full, licking her lips, and looking mischievously
at Monsalvat out of the corner of her eye.
He was thinking meanwhile that though she was
far from looking upon herself as a victim, she was
one nevertheless. Who could tell what fatal inheritance
was hers? The descendant perhaps of alcoholics
who had sought in liquor some alleviation
for the misery of their material circumstances, or
for that other misery caused by the hatred and
prejudices of their neighbors! A link by itself
meant nothing. One had to consider the whole
chain; evil could be born only of evil.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Torres was obtaining information.
The child beside him knew nothing of Eugenia but
she recalled very distinctly a girl who had come
there one afternoon. "She felt so sorry for me,"
the child went on, "and her name was Nacha. She
went away, because she had a quarrel with Madame&mdash;I
don't know what about&mdash;."</p>

<p>Madame meanwhile had admitted to Torres,
when he told her that they wanted to find Nacha
for some reason connected with "justice," that she
had been there.</p>

<p>"You put her in jail, do! That's where she belongs!
You ought to hear the language she uses!
I'm a respectable woman: I don't owe a cent to
anybody, and I'm a good mother! There aren't
many who pay more for their daughter's education!
Some of the best people in Buenos Aires are my
friends and that impudent little hussy allows herself
to talk back to me!"</p>

<p>As the two men were leaving they met an acquaintance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of the doctor's at the curb. Just as she was
getting out of a taxi Torres inquired of the seductive
Amelia if she could give him any news of Nacha.</p>

<p>"Go to Juanita's. Someone told me only yesterday
that she went there. I must say I don't understand
Nacha. Juanita's of all places! Such a crazy
thing to do! One must keep up one's position,
don't you think? There's no need of stepping down
in the world before one has to. She just lowers
herself going to Juanita's.... How am I looking,
darling Doctor? Am I getting old, do you think?
Well, so long! Good-bye, old man!"</p>

<p>It was still only about six o'clock; and they decided
to go to the Sanmartino house then and there.
Juanita received them in a large parlor, stuffy with
hangings and filled with pretentious furniture.
With her usual stately dignity and Victoria-like appearance,
Mme. Sanmartino met her two callers
very graciously. Monsalvat who was standing in
the middle of the room saw a little girl of thirteen
or so pass through the hall. He felt that behind
the portières of the doorway women were watching;
and it seemed to him that everywhere in that house,
in the air, in the furnishings, were traces of Nacha;
yet he divined also that he would not find her there.</p>

<p>"Yes, she used to come here," Juanita was saying
in an ingratiating tone, slowly moving her head
up and down. "A very nice girl, too. Quite pretty!
But she doesn't come any more. No doubt she has
found somebody to take care of her...."</p>

<p>She stopped, and looked at both men fearing her
words might have wounded one of them. Monsalvat
had not been able to control a start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, anyway, she doesn't come here any more,
but I don't know why. Sometimes our patrons take
girls away from the house&mdash;and set them up. But
I don't think that in this case...."</p>

<p>Monsalvat turned pale. He had lost her again!
But Torres inquired the name of the patron who
had made friends with Nacha, and Juanita gave it
to him at once. Then, in the silence that followed,
the doctor looked at his friend and nodded. Monsalvat
understood. Now was the time to ask about
Eugenia; but he had not the courage. Torres came
to his rescue, but obtained no satisfaction. Perhaps
the girl had changed her name! Monsalvat described
her. But what good was his description?
There were several girls in that very house who
answered it.</p>

<p>"Did you see that child in the hall?" Monsalvat
asked nervously when he and Torres reached the
street.</p>

<p>"That's Juanita's daughter. It's strange, isn't
it? Juanita is sacrificing herself for that child. She
hopes to work up a business that's good enough to
sell, and then retire on a small fortune. It's for
her daughter's sake that she exploits other women!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat demurred. "Why did she keep her
daughter in such surroundings?"</p>

<p>"Why, those girls wouldn't say a word in that
child's presence that she oughtn't to hear! Of
course, now and then, they may let something slip
without thinking. But, after all, that child couldn't
help but consider that the relations between men
and women are nothing but a simple business arrangement.
She will see that the girls she knows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
sell themselves, and she too will sell herself, to some
good fellow with a fortune; but her price will be
not twenty or thirty thousand dollars but a hundred
thousand. She'll make a good match."</p>

<p>Monsalvat was losing hope. That inferno was
too vast, the catacombs of this subterranean world
too obscure and intricate! Torres, as if to cheer
him, drew a paper from his pocket. It was a sinister,
a terrifying list of two hundred houses of the
kind they had just visited, some of them aristocratic,
some of them middle class, most of them
modest or shabby; and somewhere in these houses
were the women they sought! Monsalvat kept the
list, but decided to continue his search alone. He
could not take up more of the doctor's time.</p>

<p>Torres insisted, however, on taking him to a
house where there was a good chance of obtaining
information. They sent in their names and a servant
ushered them into a room which had none of
the perfumed, wholesale, elegance of Mme. Annette's
house, nor the heavy, mediocre luxuriousness
over which Juanita queened it. Here everything
was extremely simple without being actually shabby.
The owner of the establishment was not long in
appearing.</p>

<p>"Florinda," said the doctor, "this is my friend
Monsalvat&mdash;and this is my friend Florinda, the
most charming of creoles...."</p>

<p>"At your service, gentlemen. I am entirely at
your orders, but don't believe what this flatterer
says. He's an old friend&mdash;from good old times,
long past. But sit down sir! So honored by your
call...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>Florinda, a creole, in the forties, tall and thin
and decidedly plain, was married, and had a battalion
of children whom she kept at the back of
the house. The youngest was six months old. Her
husband was obligingly unaware of his wife's occupation;
and he was too prudent, "too good-natured,"
Florinda put in, to inquire as to the source of the
money which supported him. He always left the
house early in the morning and returned late at
night. He loved and admired his faithful consort,
model of wives and housekeepers, and always proclaimed
her a "thorough lady." His own claims
to distinction, a slow and pompous manner of speaking,
exaggerated manners, constant praise of his
wife's good qualities and his amazing physical
beauty, attached her with unbreakable bonds to this
ideal husband.</p>

<p>"Oh, you want to know something about Nacha,
sir?" Florinda murmured, in her thin and somewhat
sleepy voice. "Yes, I know her. Distinguished,
isn't she? Always very correct, and very kind! I
know her. I have the pleasure of her acquaintance,
and I have always been very fond of her, for I know
how to value people, and I always recognize good
breeding. I can't bear people who are ill-bred.
And I always say that breeding is something that
can't be taught. You get it in your cradle. Good
blood is the best certificate...."</p>

<p>The conversation went on at length. Torres
always found this woman amusing. Now and then
he produced a word or phrase of double meaning,
whereupon Florinda would lower her eyes, and
smile, looking like a plump, good-natured cat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>However, she did not know Nacha's lodging
place, and had never heard of Eugenia. The two
friends left, Florinda taking leave of them with a
whole series of bows, pretty speeches, and every
manner of courtesy.</p>

<p>"Now there's a woman who really thinks she's
respectable and she sold her own daughter. Queer,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"We are all responsible for things such as that,"
Monsalvat exclaimed, as if thinking aloud. "In
that sale, the man who bought the girl was guilty,
and the parents and friends of the man to whom
she was sold had their share of guilt; and the teachers
who taught that man; and the authors of the
books he read. For who of all these prevented
that sale? And what law have the law-makers
devised to abolish these evils? And weren't all
those who looked on, and did nothing to prevent,
accomplices?"</p>

<p>Torres did not accept this collective guilt. From
his point of view the man responsible for a crime
was the man who committed it or the man who
helped directly. Society? Bah! What was society
but an abstraction? Only the individual exists, and
society is made up of individuals. Monsalvat took
leave of the doctor because he did not want to
discuss theories with him; he was in no mood for
discussion. He affirmed, and roundly, dogmatically,
sometimes with the ideas and often in the very
language of the prophets....</p>

<p>Monsalvat, his list in his pocket, continued his
journey next day through the regions of the accursed.
Two days later, as his eye fell quite by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
chance on the police news in the morning paper, he
learned of his sister's death. The item gave the
drug addict's name, mentioned her career as a courtesan;
and after thus delivering over to public
ignominy a respected name, went on to moralizings
of the kind always available in the make-up rooms
of certain newspapers.</p>

<p>Eugenia's death, and under such conditions, was
a heavy blow. Monsalvat suddenly grew ten years
older. Now he was indeed alone. His attempts
to find Nacha became frantic; failure exasperated
him. No sooner was he out of his office in the
afternoon than he jumped into a taxi and started
off on his search; so all October passed.</p>

<p>But these regions of the lower world cannot be
traversed with impunity by the first corner. Monsalvat
did not know the ways of these circles; and
he experienced annoyances, insults, all manner of
humiliation. In some houses they demanded money.
In one he was robbed. On more than one occasion
he failed to gain admission and was bespattered with
gross words from within the fast-locked doors; and
all the while he suffered for these unhappy inmates
as well as for himself, and came out from his exploration
of the dark wood of evil, his heart bleeding,
his soul aching, and his brain confused and
exhausted.</p>

<p>Everything was useless! Nowhere was there
trace of Nacha. Time and hope were passing, and
Monsalvat began to have periods of doubt. Perhaps
he would not find Nacha; perhaps he had not
found himself! In moments of weakness he regretted
the comparative happiness of his former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
life. He began to believe himself defeated, and
fell into profound discouragement.</p>

<p>He tried to forget; he planned several articles;
he thought again of his proposed remodelling of
the tenement building, held in check by the obstinacy
of his tenants. Poor creatures! Exploited for
centuries, their grand-parents, their parents, they
themselves, knew nothing else; how could they then
sense his good intentions? Their whole experience
prevented it. They could not help believing that
his plans concealed a new form of exploitation; and
they considered his request for them to move as
an infringement on their rights. They were now
protesting angrily against the regulations of the
new superintendent who was trying to make his
tenants observe a few elementary practices of public
hygiene. Monsalvat was anxious to have the
work begun; for the sum lent him by the bank was
in danger of disappearing what with his constant
charities to people who really needed aid, and to
those who imposed upon his good faith and sympathy.</p>

<p>One afternoon in November he went to the tenement
house. In its over-shadowed courtyard hungry,
ragged children were running about; a few
women waiting for a husband or a daughter to come
home, sat paring vegetables, while someone at the
back of the house played an accordion. The yard
was littered with boxes, boards, baskets, broken
flower-pots, and all sorts of articles. At sight of
Monsalvat, the children began rushing from one
end of the house to the other yelling that the landlord
had come. One might have thought from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
their mother's expressions that they were announcing
an enemy.</p>

<p>The court was soon full of people, for many of
the tenants were home from work at that hour.
Monsalvat noticed a girl, rather well dressed, and
wearing a large hat, who drew near to one of the
groups as he began speaking:</p>

<p>"You showed me a little while ago that you did
not trust me; and when I thought it over, I decided
you did right, for I hadn't talked to you sincerely,
although I tried to. But I didn't know how to tell
you what is so simple after all; and it is that I can't
help thinking of you all as my brothers, because
you <em>are</em> my brothers; and I want to free you from
needless suffering. I'm not much. I can't do a
great deal for you. I can't even give you this house
because it's mortgaged; but it's mortgaged so that
you can have air and light and sanitary conditions,
so that you can live like human beings. All the
money raised on this house will be spent on it to
make it a good house to live in. Then you will
come back to it and you will pay me very little rent,
less than you pay now. All I want from you is
enough to pay the interest on the mortgage. I
could sell this house and rent another; but I cannot
have you herded together like cattle! Please
don't doubt me. I am not your enemy, I am your
friend...."</p>

<p>But they did not understand. "He's some joker,"
a sharp voice exclaimed. Someone else invited him
to shut up and go away. That struck the crowd
as humorous and there were bursts of laughter.
The children, no longer scared, clapped and shouted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
A creole, who was a typesetter and an anarchist,
was about to make a speech in behalf of those who
refused to accept the plan, when there was a sudden
commotion.</p>

<p>"There's that street-walker turned traitor!"
yelled one of the women shaking her fist at the girl
Monsalvat had noticed.</p>

<p>Everyone turned on her, insulting her and threatening
her. The girl defended herself vigorously;
until suddenly she began to cry. This pacified the
tenants. Only the women scoffed at her tears, not
believing that one such as she could really weep.
They would have liked to scratch her and tear out
her hair in vengeance for her hats and dresses
which seemed so fine to them. How ironical that
this girl should be the only one of his audience to
try to defend Monsalvat, and to insist that the plan
he proposed was to everyone's advantage!</p>

<p>Earlier in his career Monsalvat would have been
amazed that of all these people, a good sort after
all, no one but this girl should understand him! But
now it seemed to him quite natural. He had learned
that girls such as she know the full meaning of
suffering; and he knew now that grief was the school
for kindness and understanding. Moreover, a girl
of this profession, even though born into the laboring
class, does not belong to it. Through her dealings
with the rich, she acquires the ways of the rich
and she learns to understand these ways. In addition
her experience of men teaches her that, if some of
them are possessed of perversity and cruelty hard
to conceive of, others have an equally unbelievable
kindness of heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsalvat saw that it was impossible to convince
these people by any such methods as those
he had tried, and went away. But he returned the
next day, and every day; for he was determined to
make friends with his tenants. He found work for
some of those who needed it, and he was generous
to those who could not pay their rent.</p>

<p>One day he talked with the girl who had taken
his side in the courtyard scene. She was a short,
sad-faced little thing, who behaved so properly in
the house that no one could have guessed the nature
of her trade. He listened with sympathy but with
no particular interest to the story she was telling
him of her experiences, until she began talking
about Florinda. Then it occurred to him to ask if
she knew Nacha. She replied that she did not; but
a week or so later she announced to him with a
smile that she had just met the girl he had asked
her about.</p>

<p>"You called her Nacha, didn't you? A slender
girl who lived awhile with Pampa Arnedo? Well,
go to this address. The house belongs to a woman
who is paralyzed and pushes herself about in a
wheel chair. I go there quite often; and Nacha
and I are getting to be good friends."</p>

<p>But Monsalvat was no longer listening. He could
hear nothing now in the whole wide universe but
the words ringing in his heart.... Nacha found!
Nacha at this address! And he actually held the
address on a slip of crumpled paper in his hand!
Never had Nacha seemed so near as at this
moment....</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p>That fifteenth of November was, for Nacha
Regules, one of the unforgettable days of her
life; for it brought her intense happiness and at
the same time almost unbearable sorrow. She had
not gone to the house of the paralytic the day before,
as she was occupied in moving to another
boarding house. Doña Lucía's had become distasteful
to her since she had discovered that one
of the men there was accustomed to spend the afternoon
reading in one room while his wife received
men in another. She had made inquiries of the
other boarders, expressed her indignation, complained
to Doña Lucía. The husband thereupon
sought an interview with her. He was a vigorous
blond, with a yellow mustache, prominent eyes, and
a misshapen mouth.</p>

<p>"You have the wrong idea about me," he began.
"I'm an honorable man; I never owed a cent to
anybody, and what's more, I don't owe anybody a
cent now; and what my wife does is her own business,
a private matter...."</p>

<p>Nacha did not care to talk with him; so she told
him he was quite right and put an end to the interview.
However she left the house two days later.
On account of an unpleasant incident at Juanita's
she ceased going there also; and Julieta introduced
her to her friend, the paralytic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>She arrived at this woman's house early one
afternoon, and found her alone. The paralytic
asked to be read to and Nacha began reading aloud
the interminable novel her employer was engaged
upon. Nacha had felt depressed and nervous when
she arrived, although she had no special reason for
feeling so; but this narrative full of absurd adventures,
related in an even more absurd style, amused
and diverted her. She read for nearly an hour.
The paralytic, by no means stupid nor illiterate, had
no very high opinion of such hair-raising stories;
but she had no other book on hand to entertain
herself with. At three o'clock the servant, with a
suggestion of mystery in her manner, called her
mistress out of the room. The paralytic rolled herself
down the hall to the parlor. In a short time
she returned and told Nacha someone wanted to
see her.</p>

<p>"Who is it? Tell me! If you don't I won't go&mdash;I
can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her heart was pounding violently as if it were
the clapper of a swinging bell. Fear vibrated
through her and an indefinable distress; though she
knew that Monsalvat was there ... and yet ...
trembling, she hesitated, not knowing whether to
run away or throw herself into his arms.</p>

<p>"It's a friend of yours. Why do you want to
know who it is? I don't know him. He looks all
right, and that's enough for me. He's waiting for
you. Go along! I tell you he's a friend&mdash;but what's
the matter with you? Are you afraid of something?
If there is anything wrong I won't let you go&mdash;"</p>

<p>This put an end to Nacha's indecision. Fear of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
not seeing him took possession of her, soul and body,
and pushed her down the corridor to the room
where he was waiting. She was still trembling;
she did not know what she was going to say, nor
how she was going to act, and she wanted to cry.
Even at the door she hesitated, and felt faint; everything
grew blurred around her. She heard the voice
of the paralytic following her down the hall, calling,
"Go in! Go right in!" She heard a voice clamoring
from her heart commanding her to open the
door.&mdash;Then what happened she never knew.
Someone must have opened the door from within,
and then closed it. She was trembling and weeping,
her hands pressed to her face. She could not see
Monsalvat; but she felt his presence beside her.</p>

<p>When she raised her eyes she saw what anguish
was, an anguish made up of torturing memories,
and the presentiment of a fatality even then rearing
insuperable obstacles between them; yet this
pain only added to the intense joy of that moment.</p>

<p>"Nacha, why did you drive me away that afternoon?
That was the beginning of all the unhappiness
I have had since. Perhaps I didn't act as I
should have done. Well, then, I ask you to forgive
me. Since that day I have thought only of you.
The problem of your life has become the problem
of mine. I have searched for you in all the places
I could think of&mdash;and how it hurt, Nacha, not to
find you...."</p>

<p>They stood there facing one another, her hands
in his. Nacha, in her emotion, lowered her head.
She did not know how to act with this man who
was so simple and so good. She felt that she too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
must be frank and straightforward. She had no
right to conceal anything from him, disguise her
real thoughts, lie to him. She could not foresee
what the outcome of this meeting was to be. Should
she let herself be carried along by whatever happened?
If Monsalvat should want her, why she
was his, body and soul! If not, what then?</p>

<p>And now she was beside him on the sofa, listening
to what he was saying; and while he told her
of all the efforts he had made to find her he wondered
if the woman sitting beside him could be
worthy of a passion such as his. Fearful of analyzing
his emotion, fearful that his thoughts might
dwell too long on this doubt, he tried to put all his
feeling and enthusiasm into his story. His words
summoned before Nacha, breathlessly listening, the
long caravan of his dreams, his life of other years,
and his life now; he talked to her of the ideals
which tormented him, and without which he could
not live; and he told her that at last he had found
out the purpose of a man's life: to work for others,
to live for those who have need of us.</p>

<p>Nacha was listening in silence. Sometimes she
had dreamed of what this meeting of theirs would
be like; and she had imagined that nothing at such
a moment could serve their emotion but abandonment&mdash;kisses,
caresses more than humanly sweet.
For such, to her then, was love; but now she understood
that there was a love greater than that. She
was undaunted, but surprised. She did not know
whether to delight in it or be saddened by it. The
man she was listening to was not of her world;
to her he was an enigma, something perhaps too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
far above her for her groping comprehension. She
could not hope ever to understand him. How could
she, poor fallen woman that she was, destitute of
every possession, rise to the world of a being such
as he? And sadness cast a beautifying shadow
over her face. Monsalvat noticed the distress in
her eyes and asked why she was troubled. She
made a great effort not to burst into tears, using
all her strength of will to master her weakness.
And she won. Suddenly she perceived that she too
was strong, for her will had made its decision.</p>

<p>"I am sad ... because ... I do not love you.
And I know that I never shall!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat, in complete stupefaction, looked at
her. He could not understand. He had always
believed this woman loved him. He had felt, as
one feels a human presence that can neither be
heard nor seen, the presence of a great love between
them. And now ... it was impossible!
What was the secret of this baffling mystery? Could
Nacha be once more under Arnedo's control? He
tried to prove to her that it was himself she loved;
and as do all lovers, he presented arguments that
sober sense would have declared absurd. The whole
strength of his case lay in the tone of his voice, and
the sincerity of his emotion.</p>

<p>"No, I do not love.... It's no use. I can never
love you. You have been very kind to me, very
generous, and loyal. I love you as a friend ...
but that is all."</p>

<p>Her words seemed only to show Monsalvat to
what extent this passion possessed him. At times
he had believed that the feeling animating him was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
simply a desire to regenerate this girl who was
worthy of a better fate than the one he saw her
struggling with, a desire to save another human
being from falling to the lowest depths of evil, a
desire to accomplish something for the sake of good;
since, up to that time he had lived only for himself.
At the same time he believed that he loved her;
but this love of his seemed to mingle with all these
other feelings and desires. Now, with genuine terror,
he saw that all his ideals, all his desires of
regeneration for her and for himself, were either
disappearing, or retreating to the background of his
consciousness. At that moment he was nothing but
a man in love, and she the adored woman! Nacha
was no longer a wanton needing to be saved. All
that had not the slightest importance. It was
blotted out of his mind, in fact; and there remained
only the body and soul of a woman for whom he
would have given his life. In his absorption in this
tremendous fact he quite forgot himself; and he
was shaken by a convulsion that rose from the
depths of his soul.</p>

<p>"Yes, you love me, Nacha, and you must belong
to me&mdash;for life. I promise to make you happy.
Whatever tenderness, whatever good there is in me
is all for you, Nacha. I'll do whatever you want,
whatever you command...."</p>

<p>He was suddenly startled and he checked himself.
How far was he going? The idea of offering
himself as a husband passed through his mind.
He grew red, and was deeply distressed. The idea
seemed absurd. Then, as it occurred to him that
this was the only means of winning Nacha, he clung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
to the idea desperately. She could not refuse such
an offer. It would make her understand the extent
of this affection. A man of his position, a man of
talent, respected in the community, marrying a girl
who had offended against its code! Nacha would
be thankful; she would know how to value such a
sacrifice.</p>

<p>"Nacha," he began solemnly, "I shall make you
my wife. You must marry me...."</p>

<p>Nacha was profoundly stirred. She tried to
speak and could not, so hard was she fighting for
self control. She only could know what a ghastly
struggle that was because she knew how she loved
him. She had loved him too much before. It was
worse now, after hearing his generous words. A
voice whispered to her to throw herself into his
arms. Something in the very centre of her being
was impelling her towards him; but another voice
told her she had no right, outcast as she was, to
marry this man; that such an act would make her
guilty forever of having destroyed him as a part of
society. A sacrifice was demanded of her! She
must be more generous even than he, subdue herself,
suffer, submit to her fate, refrain from dragging
him down with her! She did not know where the
voice came from. It may have been crying out to
her from that afternoon when she first listened to
Monsalvat telling her to suffer in order to find redemption;
but it was a voice that awed her tormented
soul even while it bade her speak and leave
this man. Then the strange serenity of sacrifice
came to her rescue. She was pale as death, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
smiled so as not to weep. She summoned all the
love within her not to let her yield.</p>

<p>"Yes, you must marry me," Monsalvat was insisting
desperately.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What is it, Nacha? Why are you so strange?
I love you, you love me...."</p>

<p>Her will triumphed. She called to mind other
moments of her life and made one supreme effort.
Then she began to laugh.</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't love you. All this is ridiculous
anyway! Such make-believe is unworthy of you.
I put you out of my house once before, and I'll do
it again. You simply want to make fun of me,
because I'm a poor girl, and defenceless. You
wanted to make a fool of me, getting me to swallow
all this stuff! But now it's my turn to laugh at you,
just as I did in the cabaret. I&mdash;married! And to
you, a crazy man!"</p>

<p>She broke into a laugh that was loud and false
and harsh.</p>

<p>Monsalvat remained seated, his hands clasped
over his head; he was dizzy with pain, and he could
not understand....</p>

<p>"You are mad ... you have gone mad!" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Was she really fainting? She saw Monsalvat
cover his face with his hands; she turned to the
wall and leaned against it, letting herself weep for
a brief moment. There was relief in that. With
renewed strength, she sat down on a chair and
waited. Soon Monsalvat stood up. He too was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
pale as he came near her and, barely looking at her,
held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Some time ... you will ... let me see you?"
he faltered.</p>

<p>"No. Why should I? I don't love you. Leave
me. And if it's true that you love me, forget me
as soon as you can. Go, please! I am ill, and want
to be alone...."</p>

<p>Monsalvat did not insist. He could not have
done so. He took his hat and went away, stumbling
like a man who has come to the end of his strength.
One might have thought him sick, or crazy, or perhaps
drunk, as he staggered out. Crossing that
threshold was like wrenching his soul from his body;
and in the little parlor that knew only shabbiness
and shame, grief remained, lending it a dignity it had
never known before.</p>

<p>Nacha could no longer hold her anguish at bay.
She snatched off her hat with a frantic gesture, and
tore it into bits. Moaning and weeping she fled
into one of the other rooms and threw herself down
on the bed.</p>

<p>The cripple rolled her wheel chair to the door
and looked in. Believing that she understood
Nacha's trouble, she did not disturb her, but went
away again. She talked to the girls awhile; but
the tragedy she saw close at hand saddened her;
for it reminded her of old intimate griefs of her
own. She too, in her youth, had known love, in
far away Italy; and that love had been maimed and
destroyed. After that, dishonor and vice seemed
a small matter; yet, at times, even now, she went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
back in thought to the home of her childhood, so
different in its simple beauty from the wretchedness
of her present surroundings. But here she was,
old, crippled, with no choice but to go on in the
familiar rut. Why let herself be saddened then?
She had known life, and found that melancholy had
a bad effect on the liver! So she chatted with the
girls, merrily, as was her custom whenever she felt
a touch of sadness.</p>

<p>But someone came in, and asked for Nacha. The
cripple rolled her chair into the bedroom where
the girl was still weeping, her head almost hidden
by the pillow.</p>

<p>"Nacha child! Don't cry that way! Why let
yourself suffer so? No man is worth it. You know
that. You are worth more than the best of them,
you have a good heart ... and they...."</p>

<p>She muttered an obscene word to herself and
began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Come, Nacha, someone wants to see you. They
are all alike! No one of them is worth more than
another. They're all rotten&mdash;just good to ruin
women and then desert them. Come, child, come&mdash;here's
a friend!"</p>

<p>She patted Nacha on the shoulder, and told her
she would send her caller in. Nacha suddenly sat
up. She wiped away her tears and said quietly,
"No, señora. Don't send him. I am going away
for good."</p>

<p>"But, child, why? Are you angry with me?" the
old cripple exclaimed, astonished by Nacha's tone.
"Aren't you ever coming back to my house?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Neither to your house nor to any other. I am
not angry. You have been very kind to me, and I
shall never forget it."</p>

<p>"Well then...." The woman did not know
what to make of the girl's words.</p>

<p>Nacha was silent while she smoothed her hair,
and straightened her dress. Then she kissed the
cripple, took both her hands and said, her lips
quivering with pain:</p>

<p>"It's because ... I want to be worthy ... of
that man's love...."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. You want to be respectable for
awhile, and then get married...."</p>

<p>The cripple spoke with the certainty of a woman
who understands what she is talking about. Nacha's
expression, however, indicated that her purpose
was not quite as the cripple supposed.</p>

<p>"What is it then? Tell me. You know I like
you, child, and respect you. And I'd do for you
anything you ask. If you want to live decent, and
need money, I'll give it to you&mdash;I'll save so I
can!"</p>

<p>Nacha was touched.</p>

<p>"You are good, señora. I thank you from my
very heart; and because I know how good you are,
I'll tell you. No, I'm not going to get married.
I couldn't let him marry me. But he loves me&mdash;so
much! And if he gives me such great love, I want
to be decent. Not to get married, no, just to be
worthy of living in his thoughts, and in his
heart...."</p>

<p>The paralytic drew the girl's head down to her
twisted old lips and kissed her. Freeing herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
from the woman's embrace, Nacha hastily left the
room.</p>

<p>As she fled down the stairs she realized that it
was many years since she had felt as happy as at
that moment!</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p>One afternoon as Torres was lunching with
Ruiz de Castro in a restaurant on the Esmeralda
he thought he caught a glimpse of Nacha.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it was Nacha. She was returning
to the store where she had been employed
some six years earlier, and with her were a number
of other girl employees, for it was nearly two
o'clock, the end of the lunch hour. Torres would
have gone up to speak to her if he had been alone;
but Ruiz was relating his adventures with that
plump lady who had carried on so persistent a
discussion with Monsalvat at de Castro's dinner
party, and had so eloquently defended established
institutions.</p>

<p>"You don't say!" murmured Torres, absently;
for all his attention was fixed on the slender figure
hovering in front of the huge shop door which was
about to open and swallow her up.</p>

<p>"She's a wonder, my friend," proclaimed Ruiz,
who was given to committing indiscretions in words
as well as actions. "What passion! and how she
can sob!"</p>

<p>When Torres reached his house he went at once
to talk to Monsalvat who was now living with him.
After the serious illness that had followed close
upon his interview with Nacha, Torres had taken
him in hand, and when he discovered that his patient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
was paying no attention to doctor's orders, had
carried him off to his own home where he could
insist on obedience. He persuaded Monsalvat to
ask for a two months' leave, for there was no doubt
that he was suffering from brain-fag and serious
nervous derangement.</p>

<p>Torres had a theory that Monsalvat's condition
was not entirely due to his passion for Nacha. He
knew the history of his friend's moral struggles,
and he believed that the causes of Monsalvat's illness
were numerous and complex. The latter's
abrupt change of attitude towards life could not but
profoundly affect his whole nature. Following this,
had come several months of constant self-reproach,
and self-disgust for the uselessness and selfishness
of his life up to that time. He went as far as to
blame himself for his inability to transform the
world. Torres had tried, vainly, to prove to him
that he was far from useless, and that no one could
have called him selfish. His conduct compared
surprisingly well with that of other men of his generation;
and his reputation indicated general recognition
of that fact. Monsalvat protested that all
this might be true from a superficial and worldly
view of his life, but it only proved how false were
society's standards.</p>

<p>"Useless and selfish," Monsalvat repeated.
"Not less so than prominent politicians or ranch
owners, lawyers, and men in society. We are all
selfish. I do not condemn myself only. I condemn
all the rest as well. The world is full of evil, selfishness,
meanness&mdash;and I have shared in it all. That
is why I despise myself, and abhor my past life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Torres wisely kept silent, for fear of exciting his
patient.</p>

<p>It was clear also that the knowledge of his sister's
mode of life, and of the degradation his mother had
fallen into before her death, had seriously injured
Monsalvat's nervous system. The scene with Irene,
his worrying about the tenement, the anxieties of
that search through the world of fallen women, the
sight of so many horrors, had all left their mark
on him; and finally the shock of Eugenia's death,
intensified by the manner in which he had learned
of it, had played its part in undermining his health.
Obviously his love for Nacha, his unsuccessful attempt
to save her, the knowledge that she was
leading a vicious life, perhaps because of him, were
the principal causes of his breakdown, but all these
other matters played an important part in bringing
about his present condition.</p>

<p>Now, however, after two months of rest and
quiet, Monsalvat was beginning to be himself. The
companionship of Torres had done him a great
deal of good. The doctor made him eat, gave him
stimulants when he needed them, encouraged him
to spend most of his time out of doors and even
stayed up with him on the nights when he was unable
to sleep.</p>

<p>Torres might have accomplished a complete cure,
had not the evil that flourishes in certain human
hearts prevented. Monsalvat had recently received
some anonymous letters, four in all. One of them
insulted him by insulting his mother, another called
him to account for living on women, and being an
anarchist! The other two were content with intimating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
that he belonged in a lunatic asylum, and
would soon be put there. The effect of these letters
was to excite him so that he could neither sleep nor
eat. The first especially reawakened in him his
life-long obsession, cruelly reminding him of what
was, in his estimation, the reason for his moral
bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The doctor wondered who could have sent these
letters, for Monsalvat's position was not such as
to excite envy. At the Ministry his new ideas had
become known, and Monsalvat was looked upon
with hostility or contempt. Even the Minister mistrusted
him now. In the social circles where he
was once respected, he had lost all consideration.
Ercasty was methodically discrediting him, with
admirable persistence and thoroughness. Informed
by mutual acquaintances of Monsalvat's views with
respect to Nacha and other girls of her sort, and
of that frantic search through houses of ill-fame,
he confirmed the rumor that Monsalvat had fallen
very low indeed. At first he was content with making
insinuations; but finally he came out with the
bald statement that Monsalvat was a vulgar exploiter
of women. Of course there were not lacking
those who accused him of participating in frightful
anarchist plots, and preparing bombs for wholesale
assassinations.</p>

<p>Financially too he was ruined. The forty thousand
of the mortgage raised on his property had
melted away. His mother's debts, the mulatto's
blackmail, Moreno's incessant appeals, had taken
several thousand. His excursion through the city's
public houses had cost him four thousand <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Ten thousand <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> had gone for improvements
on the tenement. Monsalvat decided he would have
to sell the building, for his salary was barely enough
for his own expenses, and his tenants either paid
no rent or paid very little.</p>

<p>That afternoon Monsalvat was reading as he
lay in bed. The book beside him was the New
Testament. On his face was reflected something
of the serenity of late afternoon. When Torres
opened the window to let in air and sunshine, everything
in the room seemed to draw a breath, and
grow animate. A bar of light like a luminous golden
coverlet spread over the bed.</p>

<p>"Look at that!" exclaimed the doctor. "And
you spend your time shut up here almost in the dark.
You'll never get well that way. You ought to go
to Palermo, stay out in the sun&mdash;and not read or
write a line."</p>

<p>"I know what I need," replied his friend quietly.</p>

<p>"What do you need? You are always mysterious."</p>

<p>Monsalvat went on reading. Torres remained
with him for a few moments and then withdrew
without a word.</p>

<p>The doctor had been observing his friend for over
a month, with constantly growing curiosity. Monsalvat's
intelligence seemed to have grown sharper
and deeper. He was still weak in body but his mind
was keener than ever. He reasoned with irrefutable
logic, and divined his opponent's arguments
at a word. Torres attributed this mental fitness to
mental exercise. His patient talked with no one
but his host, did not go out, read very little; but all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
day long he was occupied in thinking and remembering,
trying to interpret his past life, trying to
understand the significance of the life he was then
experiencing. He spent hours analyzing the persons
he knew, and with extraordinary penetration.
Torres was more than once overcome with amazement
when Monsalvat guessed his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Why should you be startled?" Monsalvat asked
him on a certain occasion. "What has happened is
simply this. I am living from within now. Up to
six months ago I lived from without, superficially;
and the life I lived seemed to be the life of other
people rather than my own. It was an objective, a
false, a lying kind of life. Just like your own and
that of nearly everyone. A materialistic kind of
life, never transcending the commonplace, devoid of
mystery, and of genuinely spiritual anxiety. But
now my eyes are open and I begin to understand.
I have analyzed myself, I have looked within; and
I have discovered a great many things there that
I knew nothing of. I know now what there is in
me, and what parts of it are worth something, and
what I must give to others. And I even begin to
suspect why I am alive!"</p>

<p>"I knew before that...."</p>

<p>Torres stopped abruptly, not caring to end his
sentence. He pretended to have forgotten what
he wanted to say.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go on? Have you really forgotten
what was on the tip of your tongue? Well,
I know what it was. You were going to say that
all that happened this past year, and the love I
found, would lead me straight to ... mysticism!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"What? No, no, not that, exactly."</p>

<p>But that was exactly what he had been thinking.
Monsalvat knew how abhorrent to a man as orderly
and normal, as submissive to society's dicta, as
Torres, the word "mysticism" must be. The doctor
had come to admit society's responsibility for much
of the unhappiness in the world; but he had no
sympathy for those heroic acts necessary to drive
out injustice. He admired Monsalvat but at the
same time considered his passion for redeeming
others a form of insanity. According to Torres a
normal man should accept things as they are. The
rebel, he who at sight of the suffering of life's victims,
breaks out into indignant accusations or takes
up some useless but heroic work, was, in his estimation,
a madman.</p>

<p>Since his recent glimpse of Nacha, Torres had
been anxious to talk to her. Once or twice he
watched the girls coming out of the shop. He saw
Nacha again, but it was very evident that she
avoided him. Convinced that Nacha did not care
to hear any news of Monsalvat, whose friendship
with him she must have known, he gave up his
attempt to communicate with her.</p>

<p>The days went by. Monsalvat never spoke of
Nacha and little by little Torres came to the conclusion
that he had forgotten her.</p>

<p>One morning, in March, Torres went to his
guest's room at a very early hour, to dissuade him
from going away.</p>

<p>"Why leave me, Monsalvat? Stay here a couple
of months longer, until you are quite all right again.
The kind of breakdown you're just getting over is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
no joke, my dear boy. And where are you going
without a cent to your name, eh? Back to your quixotic
notions about righting all humanity's wrongs,
and redeeming people who have nothing to redeem
about them? That's all nonsense, and leads nowhere.
One man alone can't accomplish anything.
All you can do is harm, filling the heads of those
poor people with wild ideas. No, my son. The
world is full of evil. Well, what's to be done? You
have to take it as it is, and get what good you can
out of it, and&mdash;'forward, march!' Eh?"</p>

<p>Monsalvat did not reply. He lay on his side,
his elbow resting on the pillow, his hand on his
breast, and his eyes turned towards the window.
But he was not looking at what was out there beyond
him: he was looking within, searching his own
heart and the hearts of a multitude of other human
beings whom he saw there standing between him
and his friend. The doctor's words reached him
from far, far away&mdash;so far that he scarcely understood
them. Meanwhile the window seemed to be
catching fire, making its offering of light to Monsalvat
as from a golden, quivering sheet of flame!</p>

<p>The doorbell rang. Without moving, Monsalvat
said:</p>

<p>"That's the postman. He is bringing a letter
from Nacha&mdash;for you."</p>

<p>Torres smiled at this prophecy; a forced smile,
however, for he feared that it might be true. He
got up and was about to leave the room when the
maid came in with a letter. The doctor signed the
receipt for which the messenger was waiting, placing
it for that purpose on the table near Monsalvat's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
bed. He did not notice that Monsalvat's eyes were
fixed intently on the small bit of paper. Then he
opened the letter and looked at its signature, disconcerted.
Monsalvat laughed, enjoying his friend's
confusion.</p>

<p>"It's from Ruiz de Castro. He wants to see
me ... some affair of his ... he doesn't say
what ..." stammered Torres, thrusting the letter
into his pocket. Then he went out, embarrassed
and perplexed, while Monsalvat smiled to himself.</p>

<p>For the letter actually did come from Nacha!
She wrote that she wanted to see Torres, but not
at the entrance to the shop. From her letter it
appeared that she did not know where Monsalvat
was. She wanted to find out&mdash;that was why she
wrote about him. She had learned that he was ill;
"Was it true?" she asked; and "was she to blame?"</p>

<p>That evening Torres went to the lodgings at the
address Nacha had sent him. He found a respectable
house, the tenants of which appeared to be
shop employees and their families.</p>

<p>"You don't know what I've been through," murmured
Nacha. "We met one afternoon, and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Torres knew something of this meeting.</p>

<p>"But you don't know why I acted as I did,"
Nacha continued. "It was because I loved him;
because I didn't want to do him harm. So that
he, distinguished and fine as he is, shouldn't be
ruined by associating his life with that of a ...
someone like myself.... You see? Since that day
I have lived straight; and somehow, I'm still alive,
although really I am dying ... with grief....
But this I accept, for his sake, and to make up for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the kind of life I led before. I accept it so that
he may not have to suffer, so that he will forget
me, and be happy, and go on with the kind of life
he ought to have&mdash;even though I die of it. What
good am I?"</p>

<p>They were alone, facing each other over a small
table, lit by a small lamp which had been pushed to
one side. Torres felt the shadows of the room
pressing around his throat, choking him. Nacha's
face alone stood out, catching the light. The doctor
was thinking of the frightful pranks Destiny can
play.</p>

<p>But this emotion passed, and the man of the
world, laden with prejudices, falsehood, cruelties&mdash;and
good, withal, replaced the plain and honest
man of feeling.</p>

<p>"You couldn't know what I've been through,"
Nacha repeated. "Since that afternoon I have
earned my living by work. First there were days
of discouragement, when I went hungry. Then I
found employment in a shop. Eleven hours a day
and thirty dollars a month! I get a bonus too. But
there are fines for the slightest thing. Altogether
I earn about sixty dollars more or less&mdash;there's no
rest during those eleven hours. Sometimes they
send me with a load of goods up to the fifth floor.
We aren't allowed to use the elevators. It isn't a
gay life, you see. But it's for him, so I don't mind!
Not so that he'll love me&mdash;I'm not worthy of living
with him&mdash;just to deserve, even at a distance, a
little of the love he has for me!"</p>

<p>Torres looked away from her; it occurred to him
that this change in Nacha was a danger for Monsalvat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
He believed he must save his friend once
for all, and to accomplish that required a lie. He
reflected that it was really too bad that deceit should
at times be necessary, even to accomplish good results.
Something inquired of him if he really believed
that the purpose he had in view was "good."
He hesitated a moment; but he remembered the
world's opinion, the world's morality, the world's
sentiments. He turned towards Nacha, and with
a gesture as if he was casting from him an unpleasant
thought, and in a hard voice, he said:</p>

<p>"You must not see him again, Nacha, ever. Anyway,
he has forgotten you. Yes! He is in love
with another woman, and is thinking of getting
married. You don't want to wreck his plans, eh?"</p>

<p>She could not see. Everything was dark. She
felt a "yes" come mechanically from her throat,
and she put out a hand, so inert, that it barely felt
the rapid pressure of another hand. Then came
the noise of a closing door, and the sound of retreating
footsteps. But darkness remained, empty ...
and endless.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As she sat at the small table, her senses dull to
everything, she did not hear a knock at her door;
nor was she aware that a man had come in and was
there, before her, waiting. A sudden leap of her
heart, and a flash of consciousness made her raise
her eyes. She thought she must be feverish, in a
delirium! She would have cried out, but something
within her, that overpowered her, muffled her voice.</p>

<p>"Nacha!" he said.</p>

<p>"Is this true? It is not a dream? Not a dream?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>They were face to face, but they could not speak.
No words could express what shone in Monsalvat's
eyes, and echoed in Nacha's breathless weeping.
The room seemed to fill with memories of the distant
past, scenes fraught with sorrow, and ancient
longings, taking on a strange, mysterious life, like
an old temple that has heard the prayers of centuries.</p>

<p>Nacha's tears were for what had been, and what
ought to have been; for what she had not wanted
to be, and what the world had forced her to become.
Monsalvat sat at her side, caressing her hands; but
he saw facing him the two men he had been in his
lifetime, and he demanded an account of them for
what his life had been, looking into their very souls,
cursing them; and before Nacha passed the different
women who had dwelt in her body, the bad
woman, and the good, the victim and the weakling.</p>

<p>And in that dim light, they understood one another,
these two suffering human beings. The light
in the heart of each shone out to the other. Their
heads drew close together. Without knowing it,
without seeking it, they kissed gently, like children
of one mother.</p>

</div>


<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p>Monsalvat that very afternoon had taken
lodgings in the house in order to be near
Nacha. As Torres signed it, he read the receipt
of the special delivery letter; and he hurried to
the Messenger Service Bureau and there learned
Nacha's address. When he reached the building
where she lived he noticed a sign announcing a furnished
room to let in this tenement which was an
old family dwelling, now rented out to numerous
lodgers. Monsalvat took the room on the top
floor facing the street. Thus, it happened that when
he appeared in Nacha's quarters he was already a
tenant in the same house.</p>

<p>Torres' efforts to find out what had become of
Monsalvat were all unsuccessful. He even wrote
to Nacha, who replied that she had not seen him
nor had any news of him. These falsehoods did
not much trouble her conscience. She wanted to
keep Monsalvat near her, have him for herself
alone; and she was fearful of his friends, of his
associates at the ministry, of everything which
threatened to interrupt her possession of him.
When, in the afternoon, she came home from work,
she could scarcely breathe with the anxiety and the
fear of no longer finding him there.</p>

<p>But the emotion she felt was to all appearances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
purely fraternal. Suffering had spiritualized it.
The first kiss had been the last. Nacha knew how
little the physical aspect of love meant. She could
not offer her lover something of as little price as
her body. To Monsalvat she would give her heart
and soul and whatever good there was in her; her
tenderness, as immeasurable as space, and her suffering,
as deep as the sea. Nor did he desire her.
Nacha was no longer a mere woman to him; she
had become a symbol, tremendously significant, of
all women who pay the penalty she was paying, of
those victims rejected by society&mdash;daughters of the
mire and of human misery; and she was his sister
as well. If at times he desired Nacha, the desire
was fleeting, a passing sentiment. He knew that
it was this sentiment which had drawn him towards
her; and in this fact he saw a proof of the wisdom
of instinct, of nature's fundamental soundness; for
desire had, in moments of vacillation and uneasiness
of conscience, led him to the right road. Now he
was no longer a man of the world, nor a distinguished
lawyer, nor anything else that he had been.
As far as the world was concerned, he was a ruined
man. But in his own eyes he had saved himself,
found a purpose for his life; the purpose to give
everything he had to others, and to suffer for them.
What did all the rest matter if, in this course of
conduct, he found what he recognized as the "Good"
he craved?</p>

<p>And so time passed. Nacha went to the shop in
the morning, and returned at night. Monsalvat
went out only to go to the Ministry, and to offer
relief to those in great need. When he came back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
from the office he gathered the children in the house
together and taught them to read; and his evenings
were for Nacha, for long waking dreams&mdash;a book
in his hands, and silence keeping watch over them
like a faithful dog. His evenings were for that
idealized love which Nacha too now understood.</p>

<p>But one evening Nacha told him of the doubts
that troubled her. Why sacrifice one's life, and
tranquillity, and happiness, for others? With so
much wretchedness in the world, what could one
man's slow and small accomplishment matter? And
why give one's whole soul to something that offered
no visible reward?</p>

<p>"Nacha," he replied, "to sacrifice ourselves for
others is a duty. It is the only reason for our living.
If we all accepted this principle, life would
be inconceivably beautiful. And what other principle
makes our lives consistent with our opinions
and our ideals&mdash;granted we have opinions and
ideals? It is an obligation we owe to those from
whom we have taken their share of happiness.
There are not many who pay this debt, not many
who comply with this law. People not only resist
the law of love implicit in sacrifice, but they will
to be selfish, and bad. But doesn't that make it
all the more our duty, Nacha, to do what we can?
We must win forgiveness for the wrongs we do our
brothers, for the guilt of society in which we all
share."</p>

<p>He stopped, and looked dreamily before him,
as though he saw some luminous object in the distance.
Then, after a moment of silence, he added:</p>

<p>"The work of one individual has tremendous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
value as an example. Good work is not lost. It
arouses other souls; and each one of these will
waken others, who, but for them, would continue
to sleep. So, little by little, daylight will come;
injustice will cease; and poverty will be a word."</p>

<p>Monsalvat was at work on two plays which
Nacha helped him to copy. They proved to be
somewhat incoherent compositions, full of anguish,
and love, and pity. They excited keen interest
among the theatrical managers to whom he submitted
them but no one cared to produce them.
Some one of the readers who examined them called
the plays "anti-social"; and they were generally
considered dangerous to established order. In
truth, they contained too much human sympathy:
but it may well be that justice, or even simple honesty,
is a serious menace to society!</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon Julieta came to call on
Nacha. She was no longer the smiling Julieta of
old. Bad luck had been haunting her footsteps of
late; and for the last few weeks she had known
what it was to go hungry. While she was telling
Nacha her troubles Monsalvat came in. Julieta
did not know him, and stopped short.</p>

<p>"It is my friend," said Nacha. "He can help
you. Go on!"</p>

<p>Julieta, reassured as much by a glance at Monsalvat
as by Nacha's words, told how her small
savings had all been spent to help Sara who had
suddenly developed a horrible disease.</p>

<p>"I thought I could earn more if I had to," said
Julieta, "but I haven't been able to. I've had to
give up my room at Lavalle Street; and they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
going to put me out of the lodging house where
I have been staying, because my rent isn't paid. I
can't go out on the street! But I'm discouraged.
What can I do? I had hoped to get away from this
life somehow; and now it seems as though I would
have to go deeper into it than ever before&mdash;and
after seeing what has happened to poor Sara! Oh,
I can't bear to think of it!"</p>

<p>"Everything is going to come out right for you,"
Monsalvat said to her gently. "What little I have
is yours. Don't thank me. No, I shall be angry
if you do. It isn't mine after all. No one is the
<em>owner</em> of money. It's stupid to think so! Don't
lose heart. I'm going to take care of all your
troubles. No, it isn't only for you I am doing this.
It's for myself, you see."</p>

<p>Monsalvat had received his salary that afternoon.
He had just paid his rent; and he gave all
that remained to Julieta, who let herself be persuaded
finally to accept it. Then he left the girls
alone.</p>

<p>As he went out of the door, he found, leaning
against the wall opposite, his legs crossed, an ill-favored
individual who looked at him with an impudent
and sinister smile. Nacha could not endure
this cross-eyed and thoroughly unprepossessing
loafer, who, it was rumored, was a police spy. His
small, close-set eyes, low forehead, crushed-in nose
and vicious expression all suggested the jail bird;
and Nacha could never see him without having a
ghastly vision of all the crimes a man is capable of;
nor was she alone in fearing him. But she learned
on a certain occasion that he knew her past life, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the discovery kept her awake many nights. As the
days passed without her hearing anything more
from him, she put aside the worst of her fears. The
man watched Monsalvat closely and even followed
him on the street.</p>

<p>When Monsalvat returned to Nacha's room,
Julieta had gone. Nacha was depressed and this
he naturally attributed to Julieta's trouble. But
Nacha was tormented by various concerns of her
own, of which she never spoke. One was her
wretched poverty. To eke out her salary she took
in sewing, and was often at work until midnight.
At a word from her Monsalvat would have given
her every cent he had, and gladly have gone penniless
and hungry. But Nacha had told him that she
was earning enough to live on. She would not
speak of her difficulties; besides if she did, Monsalvat
would work himself into a fever of indignation
against the exploiters of women workers.</p>

<p>But Nacha had other troubles too. Latterly a
terrifying idea had taken possession of her: she had
seen Pampa, and believed that he was again pursuing
her. One afternoon as she left the store she
caught a glimpse of him, and she slipped into the
thick of the crowd waiting for a street-car. When
she saw, however, that he had stopped on the corner
and was looking this way and that for her, she
hastily got into a cab. Once again she saw him
prowling in the vicinity of the shop as she was
going to work. She was terrified, and clutched her
companion's arm so tight the girl gave an exclamation
of pain. After that she met Arnedo every
day. Sometimes he had a friend with him. Just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the day before, as she was going into the store a
little late, and alone, he spoke to her. Strange
that he should remember her so tenderly! His
voice had grown soft as he spoke her name, and
his eyes seemed to look deep into hers. She trembled;
and her fear prevented her from uttering a
word; but, with terror, she realized that she could
never feel indifferent to this man.</p>

<p>And at home, sitting opposite Monsalvat, she
suffered torment, for the thought of Arnedo would
not give her any peace. Her conscience seemed to
have become an Inquisition; her thoughts, instruments
of torture that hurt her physically, clouded
her eyes, and kept her from working over her seams.
Once, at midnight, while she was sewing, the evil
thought which until then had remained something
vague, distant, nebulous, suddenly took definite and
horrible form. She struggled not to think what she
did not want to think. She would rather have died
than think it.</p>

<p>For it had occurred to her there in her room
that night that it could not be her destiny to live
the life that she was then leading. If it were, why
couldn't she be happy? Why couldn't she have
even peace? Why so much suffering? What was
in store for her? What was she looking forward
to, there? She told herself that this was only a
transitory stage in her life, only a bridge perhaps,
leading to something else. But whither? Why was
she living there near that man? Marry him? No,
she had never taken that seriously! That was a
beautiful dream&mdash;a dream that she had no right to!
Be his mistress then? Oh that, never! Nor did he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
desire it. Then she wondered what this emotion
that she felt for him could be. Did she love him?
She admired him: never had she believed there
could be such a great soul as his. To her he represented
all the Goodness in the world. But did she
love him the other way&mdash;with her senses? Yes, perhaps,
when she first met him in the cabaret! But
not now! Now he was like a father, a brother, a
son. She loved him too much to love him that way.
And with what pity she loved him! For he was
wasting his life for her, giving up his position, his
friends, neglecting even his work, living alone and
in poverty, all for her! Then the evil thought
returned. Supposing she should run away? Supposing
she should feel perfectly certain that she was
destined not to be good, and should return to the
old life? And there was Arnedo! What could
he want of her? She compared the two men, Monsalvat,
all soul, all gentleness, all idealism; and
Arnedo, physical strength, brutality, materialism.
Monsalvat attracted her soul, her thoughts&mdash;the
best in her. She trembled to think that Pampa
might again attract her physically, inflame her
senses, rouse all the desires in short, which were the
worst in her! She shuddered at the thought that
Arnedo might regain the control over her he once
possessed: and in this torment she wept for Monsalvat&mdash;and
for herself.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p>One afternoon in June, distressed by the oppressive
humidity and suffocating heat that
precedes a storm, Monsalvat went out on the balcony
of his room, and from there he saw Nacha
coming home. Her slow dragging step startled him,
seeming to announce a catastrophe.</p>

<p>He met her in the court and asked what had
happened. Nacha, speechless, held out her hand
to him. She seemed crushed, defeated by life.
Monsalvat felt certain that something serious must
have happened, or Nacha, reserved as she always
was, would never have clung in such fashion to his
hand in the presence of others. Heads were poked
out of the windows and the women and some of
the men talking or working in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> looked at
one another and began to laugh. However, Monsalvat
and Nacha were too much preoccupied by
their anxiety to separate. Monsalvat took Nacha
to her room, supporting her by an arm; and there
she told him what had happened.</p>

<p>She had for some days recently felt tired and
ill, the result of standing so many hours at a stretch,
and so frequently climbing three or four pairs of
stairs, as the employees were not allowed to use
the elevators. That afternoon she had been ordered
to carry a mannequin down several flights. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
demurred, saying that her strength would give out;
but the manager turned a deaf ear. Laden with
the heavy wooden figure, she reached the bottom
of the first flight, staggering and faint with the
strain. She set it down resolved to go no further
with it; but a message reached her to the effect that
if she did not comply with her orders, she would be
dismissed. So she attempted to go down another
flight, some of the employees laughing at the ridiculous
figure she presented, others silently pitying her.
She tried to pull herself together for a final effort,
went down a few steps, and then&mdash;she did not know
how it happened&mdash;she fell, and rolled down a half
flight to the landing. When she regained consciousness,
she found herself surrounded by employees.
The manager, watch in hand, was observing her,
and the mannequin lay in pieces near by. She asked
to go home and was told that she would forfeit
her pay for the hours she was absent, also for the
time during which she had lain unconscious. That
explained the manager's presence with his watch!
And somehow this last cruelty, trifling as it was,
took the heart out of her. What was she but a
slave, worth only so many hours work to her owner?
Then she was also told that she must pay for the
mannequin.&mdash;Pay for it? Cold, frightened, wide-eyed,
she had scarcely understood what they were
saying. Pay, yes, pay so much every month, ten
dollars a month knocked off her salary. That was
what they meant. "How was she going to live on
what was left?" "You can manage," they replied.
"That's your business, not ours." She had no
strength to argue the matter. Money, tradition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
power were all against her. Probably they had
right on their side too, as they had everything else!</p>

<p>When Monsalvat left her, he found Mauli and
some others of his neighbors near the door. They
grimaced at him. The caretaker, who had just left
the group, to avoid Fernando's seeing him, stepped
into a doorway and turned his back. Monsalvat
passed by quite indifferent to the manoeuvre.</p>

<p>But no sooner was he out of sight than the man
turned around and went to Nacha's door and
knocked. Nacha, still crying, let him in. He was
a person of disagreeable aspect, due chiefly to his
over-meek and righteous expression, and his trick
of keeping his eyes on the ground, and never looking
at anyone he was speaking to. He never laughed,
and walked very softly, with his arms close to his
body. To his tenants he was merciless. Should
they perchance fall two weeks behind with their
rent, they were dispossessed even though sick in
bed. A coward, he could nevertheless always count
on the protection of the police in case of need.</p>

<p>"I have come ... Miss&mdash;(or would Madame,
perhaps, be more appropriate?) to say that I am
obliged&mdash;to give you notice. I hope you understand.
Your conduct in this house cannot be allowed
by any one who takes his responsibilities&mdash;as I hope
I take mine&mdash;seriously. My landlady has the utmost
confidence in me, and, under the circumstances...."</p>

<p>Nacha did not understand. She looked at the
deceptive, hypocritical face, trying to guess what
words it was going to utter. She could not imagine
what this man wanted of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"There now&mdash;you're playing innocent. Well, I
don't like to explain too much in detail.... It
would be better if you noticed for yourself that this
is a decent house, and it isn't a house where women&mdash;ah&mdash;women,
such as you.... Ha! Ha! In
short, Miss, or Missus, no more calls from gentlemen!
If you want that kind of thing, you know,
there are ... well, there are places...."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken!" cried Nacha, suddenly
springing to her feet.</p>

<p>The man lowered his eyes with an exaggeration
of humility, and seemed to shrink, as he replied:
"Of course we are all human, and of course, likely
to make mistakes. Ha-ha! But we know something
about you, Miss. No, I'm not saying anything
... but.... Can you deny having lived
in a certain "house" on &mdash;&mdash; Street, eh? Am I mistaken
about that, eh? Ha ha!"</p>

<p>Nacha, in a fury, drew near him. She was impelled
to strike him and drive him out of there by
main force; but she thought of the scandal it would
cause, and of Monsalvat; and she remembered that
the odious creature in front of her had certain
powers, as representing the landlady: he was the
figurehead for a multi-millionairess, ruling for her,
collecting her rents.... To prevent her losing
thirty or forty dollars he put the hungry or the
sick out on the street, or widows with their broods
of children. It was his function to turn over the
entire amount of monthly rent to the fine lady, his
employer, so that she could eventually distribute
handsome sums to convents and sisterhoods!</p>

<p>"For all of me, Miss, you could stay. I don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
interfere with people's business. But the landlady&mdash;ha-ha!&mdash;doesn't
want women of your kind...."</p>

<p>Nacha was losing her self-possession, and with
a scream of anger, she broke out, "Shut up, you
devil! What kind? Get out of here this instant,
you coward!"</p>

<p>He opened the door and from the threshold
shouted so that every one could hear him, but all
the while keeping his appearance of humility:</p>

<p>"What kind? Your kind, Missus, and we don't
want none of your kind here!"</p>

<p>Nacha threw herself on the floor, trembling, and
with no strength left; and she heard a laugh, cruel
and startling, coming up from the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>. It went
through her like a knife. Her whole being rebelled.
She wanted to shout out in protest; but she could
only be vanquished. Then a chill crept in through
her body to her very heart and soul. She shook
for hours in its grip.</p>

<p>Monsalvat knew nothing of what had happened;
for it chanced that he had lessons to give that evening
and during the moment when he stopped at
Nacha's room on his return from supper, she did
not let him see how ill she was. He was still concerned
about her accident at the store, and urged
her not to take it too much to heart. He was going
to sell his tenement very soon, and whatever money
he received from it would be hers.</p>

<p>Three nights a week Monsalvat held classes for
some of the workmen in the district. He had begun
with three or four pupils, but they had increased
in numbers until now he had a class of twenty or
thirty. They all knew how to read. He talked to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
them about history, about the different countries
he had travelled in, about ethics. His simple eloquence
attracted these simple workers. As he commented
upon some of the day's occurrences, or a
passage in some book, he summoned before them
a vision of a new society, of an era of love, and
justice. At such times his voice rang with human
sympathy and a strange mystic fervor.</p>

<p>But on that night Monsalvat could not speak to
his class in this strain; for there was hate in his
heart. The cruel treatment Nacha had suffered in
the store had stirred him to the depths of his consciousness,
and a multitude of details accumulated
there and forgotten, had risen to the surface, looming
large with sudden significance.</p>

<p>As the workmen filed into the room they shook
hands with Monsalvat and exchanged a few words
with him. He always asked after their children,
or their wives and mothers. Then most of them
sat down. A few preferred to stand, leaning against
the wall.</p>

<p>"Today," he was saying, "I came to understand
something which I have never understood before,
though it is something true, something fundamental!
I have been talking to you about love's power to
change the world. Well, I was wrong! Love cannot
transform the world. It is nineteen hundred
years since the world heard the most sublime definition
of love. None since has surpassed it, for none
can. Yet this love, in spite of the example given
us with its definition, has accomplished nothing.
What then can we accomplish? If the words that
were spoken those many years ago have never been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
understood by mankind, that must mean that men
will never understand any words of love. So then,
we must preach hate. For to preach love is to
become the accomplice of injustice. To preach love
is to work for the preservation of things as they
are, to wait for the advent of a day that will never
come! Love is almost always passive, inert. Hate
is action. Hate will give us strength; and with this
strength we shall succeed in winning the world to
love. This then is what we must do. Through
hate, move on to love. Through violence, the instrument
of hate, impose peace, fraternity, justice!
Moreover, when we use hate and violence, we who
are the underdogs, you and I, my friends, will only
be using the methods used toward us. Those who
control, despise and hate us, and use violence against
us every moment of their lives. They have organized
hate and violence. They use force not only
in secret, but in broad daylight. I have seen how
they use it on the human body, its life and health,
imposing monstrous and destructive tasks on human
beings! I have seen how they use it on human
minds, condemning them to eternal ignorance! I
have seen them use it on women, and on children.
Even those who come to us with gentle words, hate
us and only want our servitude to continue. No,
my friends. Love will not set us free. Will the
British shareholder who receives enormous dividends
for his capital invested in our railroads, in
our large stores, in our packing houses, listen to the
voice of love? Will the tenement landlords who
throw women and sick children out on the street
listen to the voice of love? Do you believe they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
will? Will they listen to any language other than
that of check and bank note? But there is another
language which they can understand even though
they don't want to, the language of our violence!"</p>

<p>His pupils listened, motionless, but stirred. Some
of them seemed uneasy, as at the memory of a
wrong; others looked at their teacher with pity and
with pain; others appeared rapt in a vision of new
worlds. It was evident too that more than one of
them had difficulty in understanding, and that nearly
all of them were trying to establish a relation between
their own past and the words they were listening
to. For they had led lives of suffering always.
They knew squalor, and hunger; but with the years
they had grown accustomed to misery and poverty.</p>

<p>There was a pause. No one moved. No one,
not even Monsalvat, dared to speak. Something
impressive was there among those men, like a visible
presence, and they seemed all to be gazing at it;
and it was everywhere. It was in each one of them,
and in their comrade's eyes, in the echo of their
teacher's words that haunted their ears, in the deep
stillness of the room, in the rapid beating of their
hearts.</p>

<p>The silence continued. One man tried to speak,
but he looked about him at his listeners, and said
no more. At last they understood that there was
nothing to say, and they all got up simultaneously.
One by one they shook hands with Monsalvat.
Never had those hands of theirs seemed so warm,
so vibrant, so vigorous. Some of the men had tears
in their eyes, one could not have told whether from
joy or sadness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>When his class had gone, Monsalvat felt that he
had accomplished an act of justice, that he had
taken a step, at least, toward the world's transformation.
Living as he did on sentiment and imagination,
with little or no sense of reality, he believed
in the efficacy of the vague abstract formulas he
preached. In his ardent desire for a better world
there was a deal of mysticism: he lacked concrete
rules, plans of action, the realization that discipline
is the basis of progress. In his individualistic and
lyric exaltation, he imagined that by means of the
just and tragic emotions of revolt, such as he had
that evening preached, and only through such means,
could a better society be brought about.</p>

<p>The next day he received a summons from the
police. He was not disturbed; but he supposed that
the secret-service had reported him. On arriving
at headquarters he was led to the chief's office,
where he found himself face to face with an official
personage who affected Napoleonic brusqueness and
thoroughness, and tried hard, in spite of a sharp,
thin face, to look like that Conqueror. Monsalvat
knew him, which did not prevent the chief's adopting
a condescending manner towards him.</p>

<p>"It's a bad plan, my good fellow, to talk as you've
been doing," the officer said, slowly walking up and
down, his hand on his sword-belt, and putting a
degree more of stiffness into his rigidly erect carriage.
"Dangerous theories.... It's incomprehensible
to me that a man of your station in life
should plot against our government, against our
country&mdash;as if conditions here were not the best to
be found anywhere! As if anyone who wanted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
couldn't become rich in this country! You people
get a few ideas out of anarchist literature, and lose
your heads over them. All that stuff comes from
your old and rotting Europe. It has no possible
application in a country like this, where every man
has a chance, where no one need go hungry, where
no one can complain of injustice...."</p>

<p>Monsalvat, who was staring hard at the orator,
started, then looked his amazement. Surely the
man was joking! But no, he was perfectly serious,
and perfectly convinced. Monsalvat then remembered
having heard this identical speech a hundred,
a thousand times before. Worse than that, he remembered
having written those very words himself!
It was not likely that he would be convinced by all
this, nor attempt an answer. Even the Chief of
Police was aware of that, and ended the interview.
Before dismissing Monsalvat, however, he made
him read a social law which he was formulating.
Monsalvat glanced through it and took himself off,
honoring the officer with the slightest of bows.</p>

<p>Although the incident was trifling, it depressed
Monsalvat. It made clear to him what he had
become in this last year he had lived through.
Standing in that room at Police Headquarters,
observing the chief's attitude towards him, interpreting
the mere fact of his being thus summoned,
he saw clearly both what he had been, and what he
had ceased being. Before, he had had position,
money, a flattering reputation, friends. Now he
had nothing; he was but a poor devil, at the mercy
of the police. And all for what? What had he
accomplished in a year? He had lifted three or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
four women out of the gutter, taught a few men to
read&mdash;but what did that signify in the infinite sea
of human misery and ignorance? Monsalvat was
strong in his convictions and in his moral health,
strong with love of the good, strong in gentleness
and pity; but now doubt was for the moment
stronger than he, and he knew the all-permeating
bitterness of temptation. In a moment of moral
weakness he thought of giving up this hopeless task,
of returning to his own world, and to his former
station in it. A sadness, as vast as the universe,
chilled his heart, and soul, and mind. He was
wandering alone and forgotten in a ghastly wilderness;
and this loneliness in the death-like, icy solitude
of the world was too frightful to endure. He
had sought out this life he was leading for the good
of others; he had given what he had to others; he
had devoted himself to his task, with joy and faith,
with physical and moral courage; but now he broke
down, for his whole life seemed a failure; he wept
for that Monsalvat of whom he had hoped so much,
not knowing that the strongest falter on their way
and that such weaknesses are but a respite, a halt,
giving renewed strength to go on with the day's
march!</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p>That same afternoon, while Monsalvat was
wrestling with his doubts, Nacha was on the
way to Belgrano to see Julieta.</p>

<p>Tormented by her anxieties, the slow progress of
the street-car racked her nerves. She would never
get there! And now it was stopping again! She
looked angrily at the woman who dawdled cumbersomely
in getting on or off. Didn't they care how
long they took? Why were they so fat? Two or
three men near her attempted to flirt, but Nacha's
contemptuous eyes discouraged them. At the end
of the first half hour she bought a newspaper, but
when she tried to read it, she found that she did
not understand a word. She made repeated efforts
to fix her attention on the police news. At the end
of two or three phrases, a line perhaps, her mind
jumped to other things. Then she realized that she
was not reading and began again, with the same
result. At last she tossed the newspaper away.</p>

<p>The car had now reached streets where there
was little traffic, and went more rapidly. At the
end of an hour, it had arrived at Belgrano. Nacha
got out and walked along silent avenues that were
well shaded by fine trees. In her nervous haste she
almost ran past pretty villas, with their flower-filled
gardens, that spoke of peace and comfort. Over
some of the streets the trees formed an arch and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the air was sweet with perfume. Only the footsteps
of an occasional passer-by broke the silence of this
suburb, apparently the home of calm and contentment.
But Nacha could not yield to this atmosphere.
Grief and terror drove her relentlessly on.</p>

<p>Julieta was working in Belgrano in a shop on
Cabildo Street. Like Nacha, she earned very little;
but her expenses were slight, for she was living
with friends who accepted only a small sum in payment
for her room and board. Before concluding
arrangements with the husband and wife, people
from her home town who had known her family,
she told them the kind of life she had led up to that
time. The wife hesitated a moment; but the husband,
who was a militant Socialist, declared in a
loud voice, with sweeping gestures and oratorical
phrases, that there were no prejudices in his home,
that he considered it a duty to contribute to the
moral regeneration of anyone who needed it!</p>

<p>While Nacha waited for Julieta to come home,
the Socialist and his wife chatted with her while
their brood of children flocked around with staring
eyes. The man's countless questions distracted her
a little from her worries. But it required a great
effort to attend to what he was saying. Every once
in a while her expression grew blank, and her eyes
opened wide as though she were in a paroxysm? of
fear.</p>

<p>When Julieta finally appeared, she took Nacha
to her room.</p>

<p>"What is the trouble?" she exclaimed. "Something
has happened! Come, tell me about it," and
they sat down on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am running away!" Nacha said in a quivering
voice.</p>

<p>"Running away! From whom?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. From Monsalvat, from Arnedo,
from that awful man in the house there&mdash;from myself!
I am afraid of myself, Julieta! If you knew
what presentiments I have! Everything is black,
and full of horror&mdash;and crimes&mdash;and ... oh, I
don't know what!"</p>

<p>"Presentiments?"</p>

<p>"Yes, something horrible is going to happen
to me. Julieta listen! I have a presentiment
that...."</p>

<p>She could not go on, for her teeth chattered; her
throat worked convulsively, and her eyes were starting
from her head with terror. Julieta looked at
her with gentle, sad eyes, and murmured affectionately
to her, as to a child.</p>

<p>"No, no! I must tell you. You must know
about it&mdash;this feeling I have almost drives me crazy!
It makes me desperate!"</p>

<p>"But," said Julieta, "what is the matter?"</p>

<p>Nacha told her about Arnedo's renewed pursuit
of her. He wanted to carry her off! And he was
obstinate, and wild, and bad! And he always got
what he wanted! And what could she do to stop
him? He had such will power! And then ...
why did she feel this strange attraction towards
him? She didn't love him. She hated him rather&mdash;he
was so brutal with her! And yet, she never
would have left him of her own accord; and now
she was sure she would go away with him if he
insisted very much. That was what terrified her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
To go away with Arnedo, after all her struggles
to be decent! To make Monsalvat suffer so, when
he was so good to her, and had given up everything
for her sake! To go down again into that evil
world from which he had rescued her!</p>

<p>"But Nacha, you must not lose courage! I
thought you were quite safe. It was you who saved
me! Why must you go back again, if you don't
want to?"</p>

<p>"I have to! It's Fate! I always said I was
destined to be a bad woman! Every time I tried
to be good something happened to break up all my
plans. Now it seems impossible for me to be decent.
Everything is against me! Look at what happened
to me in the store! Why should everything be so
hard for me?"</p>

<p>"But why don't you tell him about it&mdash;Fernando,
I mean? He worships you, and he'll make everything
right. I am sure that he is more than a match
for Arnedo. Why doesn't he have the man arrested?
Or you can both leave the house!"</p>

<p>"But Julieta, you don't know what has happened!
That awful man, Mauli, knows about me; and he
told everyone in the building&mdash;that's why they're
all after me, laughing at me and insulting me! The
superintendent called me a name&mdash;that I deserved
perhaps, once.... Oh, if you only knew! And
they say Mauli is a police agent, a spy&mdash;Today,
when I left the store, I saw him talking to Pampa!
I couldn't move I was so scared&mdash;just stood there
frozen on the sidewalk. They tried to get out of
sight, but I could see they were on friendly terms.
Who knows but that they are planning something,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Julieta! I have imagined so many awful things. I
couldn't go home, that's why I came here. I want
to get away from those men, from Monsalvat, from
myself, from all the things I am afraid of! For
something is sure to happen&mdash;today or tomorrow,
or ... sometime."</p>

<p>Julieta insisted that Nacha should tell Monsalvat
everything.</p>

<p>"But how can I tell him that I am likely to go
away with Pampa!"</p>

<p>"Don't you love Monsalvat, Nacha? I don't
understand you! You used to adore him! Why,
you talked of nothing else! And now...."</p>

<p>"Now I love him more than I ever did. I know
how fine he is, how good&mdash;whatever you want to
call it! He wanted to marry me...."</p>

<p>"And why didn't you let him, Nacha?"</p>

<p>"Just because I love him so much. He has lost
everything on my account, position, money, friends&mdash;even
his health! I can't let him go on like that.
He ought to go back to his place in life, and leave
me to my fate. A girl like me has no right to marry
a man as good as he is and ruin him. He was
generous towards me, and I want to be generous
too. If he has sacrificed everything for me, and the
sacrifice turns out to be of no avail, I ought to pay
him back, make him give up leading a life that is
so useless!"</p>

<p>"Useless, Nacha? Haven't we both a chance to
be decent? Didn't he make you become the girl
you are? What more could any one do?"</p>

<p>Nacha was silent. Then she came closer to
Julieta and said, speaking very low:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll be good, yes! But I shall never, never be
happy. I am more unhappy now than I ever was.
Bad luck follows me everywhere. I can't be meant
for this kind of life! If I was, I ought not to be
so uneasy all the time, I ought to feel contented
at least! But I don't, I don't! And it grows worse
every day!"</p>

<p>Julieta, however, was determined to convince her
friend that she must talk things over with Monsalvat.
Nacha consented finally to go back with
her after supper, and discuss her fears with him.</p>

<p>Monsalvat meanwhile was anxiously awaiting
Nacha's return. When, after reaching home from
his visit to Police Headquarters, he discovered that
she was not in, he became alarmed. A woman who
lived next door told him that Nacha had probably
gone out to find new quarters, as the superintendent
had "ordered her out." Monsalvat at once went
down to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> in search of an explanation of this
report.</p>

<p>It was already dark. The air in the courtyard
was heavy with the smell of cooking. Mothers were
crooning to their babies, and children were whimpering.
From one of the windows came the strumming
of a guitar; and in a corner of the courtyard two
old men were gossiping in Genoese.</p>

<p>The superintendent had, until that moment, been
quite servile in his attitude toward Monsalvat. But
he knew now that this tenant of his had been called
to account by the police, and he intended to use this
bit of information. He began, however, by attracting
an audience. He intensified his attitude of humility.
As he bent his head before Monsalvat's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
energetic accusations, he had all the appearance of
being bullied by his lodger.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. You can shout if you like, and insult
me, and even strike me. I'm only a poor man, so
what does it matter? But I have to carry out my
orders. And the landlady, who is a fine woman, and
highly respectable, doesn't want anyone in this house
with dangerous ideas in their heads, nor any woman
like that!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat lost all the serenity that still remained
to him after the events of the day. He clenched
his fists, ready to attack this man, at the first word
of allusion to Nacha.</p>

<p>"So that's why, sir, I'm asking you to let us have
your room. We are very sorry, of course; but it
can't be helped! As to the young lady you're so
friendly with, let me tell you&mdash;if my respectable
tenants here present will excuse the word&mdash;we don't
want any street-girls in this house!"</p>

<p>His hearers, now fairly numerous, burst into a
loud guffaw. Monsalvat, exasperated beyond endurance,
seized the man by the shoulder and said
to him in a voice that shook with anger:</p>

<p>"You'll get what's coming to you, you hypocrite!"</p>

<p>But something made him glance around. Mauli
was standing close to him, smiling his crooked smile.
He stopped short. This evil-looking individual
represented law and order, force and reason, organized
society, of which he was one of the props! He
was the enemy, hidden until that moment, but now
revealed, his enemy, indeed, for Monsalvat felt himself
to be the only champion there of the justice and
goodness in human nature!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>The superintendent made no move to defend
himself from Monsalvat's threatened attack, but
appeared to shrink, become more humble still. He
smiled however, a treacherous and evil smile, and
with lowered eyes, he murmured meekly:</p>

<p>"You ain't fair to me&mdash;but I don't need to defend
myself! I'll trust to getting my reward in Heaven!
No, I'm not going to fight this here gentleman, but
I am going to ask the landlady to get him a pretty
suit of striped clothes, and have his head shaved,
and put him where he can have plenty of cold
showers...."</p>

<p>His audience greeted this allusion with explosions
of mirth; and encouraged by his success, the superintendent
continued:</p>

<p>"As to the young lady&mdash;excuse me, sir, the princess,
I mean&mdash;as to the fair princess in room No.
22, I'll present her with...."</p>

<p>Monsalvat had turned his back on the man, and
was trying to force his way out of the crowd. But
people, eager to prolong the scene as much as possible,
got in his way.</p>

<p>"What? What will you present her with?"
shrilled the women.</p>

<p>"I'll present her with&mdash;excuse the expression,
ladies!&mdash;with a yellow ticket!"</p>

<p>Coarse, brutal laughter greeted this witticism
and people gathered round the superintendent to
make him repeat his part of the dialogue. As Monsalvat
went slowly up the stairs it seemed to him
that these people were all flaunting their heartless
mirth in his face. He was incapable of seeing or
hearing anything. His feeling for Nacha had, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
a moment, carried him away, spurred him to violence!
But instantly, he had realized that if he did
not curb it, it would be ruinous to himself, as well
as to her. No, he could not risk leaving her alone,
abandoned to herself, and to the cruelties she would
be sure to experience.</p>

<p>After reaching his room, he began thinking of
that humanity, whose foul words and coarse laughter
were even then following him up the stairs.
Now at last he saw how useless his ideals and his
work were. What could he accomplish while men
continued to be so full of evil? Yet whose fault
was it? Whose but that of the men and women who
allow the poor to wallow in poverty, ignorance, and
the grossness which is perhaps but a protection
necessary for self-preservation? No, the evil in
these people was not inborn! It was acquired; it
came from hunger, from disease, from the sense of
being shut out from the banquet of life at which so
many feast! And little by little he began to think
of those who were still laughing at him under his
window as no more than unconscious victims; and
he pitied them, he even forgave them!</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and Nacha appeared,
accompanied by Julieta. Mauli, lounging
about the front door, was the only person in the
house who had seen them come in. As they passed,
he turned aside, but no sooner were they on their
way up the stairs than he ran to get the superintendent;
and together they tiptoed to Monsalvat's
door, where they stood with an ear to the panel,
listening, and kneeling to look through the keyhole.
What they saw was a girl sobbing, and a man looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
very wretched; but this of course failed to arouse
any compassion in them. Finally when they saw
that the girls were taking leave of their host, they
scuttled away.</p>

<p>No sooner had Nacha and Julieta left him than
Monsalvat went to the police station. He had no
fears on Mauli's account; for, unpleasant as the
man was, he was nevertheless in the employ of the
department, and not likely therefore, Monsalvat
thought, to take direct part in any plot of Arnedo's.
So he had assured Nacha, quieting her fears a little.
At the station they promised him to assign a special
watchman to the house; and the latter returned
with him, went up to Nacha's door, and told Monsalvat
he would keep watch all night.</p>

<p>Monsalvat could not bring himself to believe that
he had correctly heard the unbelievable things that
Nacha was saying. How was it possible that Nacha
should no longer love him, that she should be able
to go away with Arnedo when, if what she declared
was true, she hated the fellow! At certain moments
he thought he must have dreamed the cruel words
that rang in his ears: and that night as he lay in
bed, Despair blew with icy breath upon his hands,
and lips, creeping through his blood to his heart,
and to his brain, threatening to wither forever the
warm hope that was his life.</p>

<p>The next morning Nacha went to the store, and
returned in an almost happy frame of mind. It
had made her feel freer to tell Monsalvat how she
felt towards him. Up to that moment it had seemed
to her that she was deceiving him, and not treating
him fairly. Now an enormous weight had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
lifted from her conscience. Also she knew that
Monsalvat had understood. Her words had caused
him keen suffering, but now he would return to his
old world and forget her!</p>

<p>Monsalvat did not see her when she returned
from work. He had gone directly from his office
to see Torres. The doctor had just come in from
his calls.</p>

<p>"I told you so," Torres asserted, after Monsalvat
had related his conversation with Nacha. "No
good can come of dealing with such women. You
have got nothing out of it but disillusionment and bitterness:
you've lost almost a year of your life&mdash;and
that isn't all! Your reputation is quite done for,
my boy. You'll have a job of it, to rehabilitate
yourself socially!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat listened, wondering how this friend,
the only one now left him, could know him so little.
He had come to confide his trouble to the only
human being of his own class who would consent
to listen to him: and he had been misunderstood!
It seemed useless to explain. Abruptly, without
shaking hands with Torres, he went away, downcast
and ill. Why hope for anything from anyone?
Life weighed too heavy on him; he had no illusions,
no hopes; and then it was that he knew what the
frigid abysses of solitude are really like! Abysses
into which everything falls away, and vanishes, and
nothing, not even feeling remains....</p>

<p>Not caring to go home he wandered about the
streets. At dinner time he went into a coffee house
and drank a little coffee. Then he continued his
aimless walk for several hours, scarcely conscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
of what he was doing, or of the passing of time.
At last he went back to his room and tried to read,
but with no success. Finally he wrote Nacha a long
letter, in which he tried to convince her that she
loved him; strove to communicate his own feeling
to her, painted the serene and happy days awaiting
them if only Nacha would accept the love stretching
out its imploring hands towards her!</p>

<p>An hour passed, two hours, three hours. Monsalvat
wrote for a time, then broke off, then resumed
writing. He would get up, pace to and fro, sit down
again. It was now two o'clock. Everything was
silent; the house, and the street outside.</p>

<p>But suddenly the silence was broken. He heard
a noise like that of an automobile stopping near by.
Then a door opened, and there was a subdued sound
of footsteps in the courtyard. Monsalvat leaned
out of his window, which opened on the street; but
he could distinguish nothing. Then he went out to
the narrow hallway which led to his room. From
there he could not see the lower hall; so he went
downstairs. There was no one to be seen in the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>, and everything was silent once more. Only
in Mauli's room, almost directly facing Nacha's,
was there a light. It must have been he coming
home, Monsalvat concluded; and he returned to
his room. Then he lay down, and quite exhausted,
fell into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, however, a strange noise
aroused him. He thought it must have been a
scream; not a sharp cry, but muffled, stifled, as
though coming from a distance. Then, as his brain
cleared a little, he decided it had been from close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
at hand&mdash;from the street, from the front door,
perhaps. He heard men's voices, the noise of footsteps,
and an automobile approaching. Jumping
up from his bed, he leaned out from the window.</p>

<p>He must have uttered a frantic cry; for what he
saw was as distinct and horrible and swift as the
visions in a dream.... Four men came out from
under the archway of the front door. They were
carrying something, a dark huddled form that
moved; and now they were thrusting it into the
automobile drawn up at the curb. A woman!</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XX</h2>


<p>He did not know what to do. At the police
station they could give him no information
concerning Nacha's whereabouts. It had been ascertained,
from the testimony of three watchmen, that
on the night of her disappearance an automobile
was noticed about two o'clock in the morning, going
full speed in a southerly direction. One of the
watchmen declared he had seen a woman in the
car, and that several men were holding her down.
Another asserted that there was no woman in the
automobile he had noticed. Torres, when Monsalvat
consulted him about the matter, openly expressed
his satisfaction. In his opinion the abduction was
only simulated. He believed that Nacha had been
a party to it, that she wished to leave Monsalvat,
and had not known how to go about it.</p>

<p>"The probabilities are that she has gone off with
Arnedo. Was it likely that this girl could continue
long in the nunnery you condemned her to? Of
course she wanted Pampa! Those fellows know
how to keep the interest of women. When a girl
falls in love with one of them she never gets over
it. I know dozens of cases! It's as though they
were bewitched. Well, now you're free! That
scheme of yours really was ridiculous!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat looked at him hard. Torres was
aware of his friend's reproach but did not desist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
from his criticism. They stood facing one another
in the doctor's consultation room. Torres in his
long white apron looked even more like a Moor
than usual, for the enveloping white brought out
sharply the blackness of his eyes and crisply curling
hair.</p>

<p>"Yes, ridiculous!" he repeated. "Do you think
that such magnanimous acts suit these times? It's
all right to want to rescue a girl from living as
Nacha was doing&mdash;you may even go so far as to
fall in love with her and want to marry her! That
kind of thing happens every day. But the absurdity
in all this is that a man with your gifts should devote
himself to missionary work and go about among
lost women with the idea that he is going to save
them!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat did not care to hear more of this and
went away.</p>

<p>Within a few days a letter reached him from
Nacha. Its few short lines had evidently been
written in haste. She had been locked up, she wrote,
in a house of ill-fame in the <em>la Boca</em> section; and
she added that she was not seeing Pampa. Monsalvat
must not look for her! It was her destiny
to be "bad," and she had to fulfill this destiny. She
hoped he would be happy, and go back to his place
in the world, to that carefree life from which, all
unknowingly, she had drawn him away. Monsalvat
remained a long time looking at this letter, reading
it over and over, pausing at every word. If only
between the lines, he might discover the address of
the house where Nacha was being held&mdash;</p>

<p>Not yet defeated, he once more set out on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
search for her. He looked at the list of houses the
doctor had given him to see if there were any house
in la Boca mentioned there; but there was none.
However, there were ten or twelve in the Barracas
quarter. One afternoon, after leaving the Ministry
he set out to visit one of these.</p>

<p>In a low section of the city, at the back of a two-storied
house, in a dark corner of a street that led
nowhere, he found the wretched house that was
listed. At his knock at the door a toothless and
unkempt old hag appeared. She was standing barefoot
in the dirty water that she was swishing over
the stone floor with an old broom. Monsalvat had
never seen so lamentable a specimen of humanity.
The bony old creature was scantily covered by a
wrapper which, as it flapped open, revealed the
appalling ugliness of her shrunken, discolored flesh
and deformed body. When Monsalvat asked for
the proprietor of the house, this human remnant
showed her livid gums, and assured him she was
the person in question. With a few apologies, she
made him come in, and leaving him, went to put
on more decent attire. Monsalvat found himself
in a room permeated by a peculiar smell compounded
of incense and smoke from the stove. It amused
him to observe that the walls were papered with
pictures of saints. In a corner, a candle was burning
in front of St. Anthony. The chromos covered
everything, even the head of the wooden bed, and
the door.</p>

<p>The old woman returned somewhat tidier in appearance,
and accompanied by a red-haired girl of
about seventeen, poorly dressed, and very deaf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Monsalvat thought she must be a servant in one
of the wretched houses of the neighborhood. He
informed the old woman of his purpose in coming,
and she at once asked for money. He gave her
ten <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> which she acknowledged by telling him
that the day before a girl had told a story about a
woman who had been stolen and locked up in a
certain house in <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">la Boca</i>.</p>

<p>Where could he see the girl?</p>

<p>The old woman screamed into the red-haired
girl's ear inquiring who had told her this story.
She mentioned a name.</p>

<p>"It's someone who just happened to be here&mdash;she
isn't likely to come back. But I'll tell you where
you can see her. Do you know the Basque woman's
house? Well, they're going to have a party there
tomorrow night, and the girl is sure to be there.
Ask for Gertrude. She's a thin, dark piece ...
puts on lots of airs."</p>

<p>Monsalvat could not leave without calling the old
woman to account for her trade, or at least for
having such young girls about. The hag laughed
shrilly, opening her toothless mouth wide, and rocking
her body back and forth. Whenever she stopped
a moment in her glee she wiped her nose on her
arm.</p>

<p>"So you think we ruin girls, do you? That's a
good one! Listen, tell me! How old do you think
I am? Fifty-two&mdash;not a year more! Well, look,
in all the twenty years I've been in this business I
never deceived nor ruined any woman. A good
one, that is! I don't force women to this kind of
work. Criminal, you call it? Well, what about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the 'City of Paris' that pays its employees so little
they have to get money somewhere else? What do
you call that? Say, I know something about what's
going on! I used to be up in the world once! You
ought to have seen the folks who came to my house!
Yes, a fine idea, you have! But I don't take advantage
of anybody&mdash;Talk to me! Say, listen! Women
don't ruin other women! It's you fine gentlemen
that ruin them! That's a good one! Ha-ha! And
if some woman helps to ruin another it's not us poor
ones! That's a good one all right!"</p>

<p>The next evening Monsalvat set out for the
Basque woman's house, where he was to inquire for
"Gertrude." He went through dark sinister streets
and at last came to what he thought must be the
place. It was in a junction of two alleys, near the
<em>Hospicio de la Merced</em>.</p>

<p>A desolate quarter of the town it was, depressing
in lines and color. A short narrow street went
upgrade between two high walls, then turned
abruptly. From the direction in which Monsalvat
was approaching, the walls and trees of the women's
insane asylum alone were visible. All the rest was
sky and night. Silence like that of the desert
reigned, and a solitude fit for nameless crimes.
Monsalvat shivered with a vague uneasiness. He
turned at the end of the passage, and saw a multitude
of distant lights. The view widened. Something
ominous breathed in the thick darkness. On
one side of the street stretched a low wall; and in
the distance, beyond that, the wide inky railroad.
The huge formless bulks of empty cars mingled in
undistinguishable masses down there in those dreary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
yards; and beyond, from the skyline of the city
electric lights were glittering. Here and there yellow
signals glowed in the blackness, and to the left
stretched a line of dingy houses. The house Monsalvat
was seeking must be one of these.</p>

<p>In a building in front of him a door was open.
He could hear talking inside, laughter, the sound
of a piano. He called out to announce his presence.
Someone shouted to him to come in. From the
other end of the entrance hall a girl, who was having
some beer with her escort, called out to ask him
what he wanted. Perhaps Monsalvat's appearance
aroused mistrust in her companion. At any rate
they replied that the lady of the house was busy
and that a party was going on. Monsalvat however
was persistent. Finally they let him pass into an
inner room. The proprietress, a very tall and heavy
Basque, whom he encountered in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>, seemed
to have her doubts about him too. Monsalvat
made up some pretext for staying there a few moments,
and in addition gave the woman money.
The girl who was drinking beer turned out to be
Gertrude. The proprietress called her aside so
that Monsalvat could talk to her.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" exclaimed Gertrude. "I
heard the story; but who knows if it's true? And
what's more I don't remember anything about it.
That was a good many days ago."</p>

<p>"It isn't so many days ago, because all this happened
last week."</p>

<p>"I tell you I don't know anything about it. I
wasn't the one who told the story in the first place.
It was somebody else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsalvat noticed that the youth who had been
drinking beer with her was watching him. In the
inner room a tango was going on. From the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>
Monsalvat could see the profile of a tall mulatto
who was playing the piano, in a very temperamental
style, striking the piano case, whistling, breaking
out into song. The air was heavy with odors and
smoke, and the sensuousness of the dance floated
out into the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> like the scent of an overripe fruit.
Monsalvat was on the point of leaving, tired of his
vain attempt to get information, when the girl suddenly
changed her manner. Monsalvat thought he
had noticed the youth making signs to her, but at
the time attached no importance to this detail. Gertrude,
now gracious and smiling, said that she would
give him the address of the house the girl was
supposed to be in; but begged him not to tell anyone
she had done so, or they would kill her. At this
point the youth drew near, and in greeting to Monsalvat,
removed his cap. Gertrude mentioned a
street and number, and explained to the youth what
it was all about. The latter offered to accompany
Monsalvat. He knew the house in question, and
if the gentleman went alone, they would not let
him in. The young fellow appeared good-natured,
and Monsalvat concluded that he was probably a
young workman. With his characteristic hopefulness
where human nature was concerned he accepted
the proffered company, and, after the youth had
taken leave of three or four friends there, they
started off together.</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour they walked through
dark streets entirely unknown to Monsalvat. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
they came out on a wilderness of vacant lots. Suddenly,
as they turned a corner, his guide gave a
peculiar whistle so shrill that it pierced the darkness
like a knife. Before Monsalvat could ask what this
meant he saw four toughs descending on him with
pointing revolvers. Obviously this was no time for
talk, nor for complaint. Resignedly he handed over
all the money he had with him.</p>

<p>He was not disheartened, however, nor was he
angry with the thieves. He told himself that the
poor devils no doubt needed the money, and thought
no more of the incident. Following, as he believed,
the same road he had come by, he reached the river,
and at sight of it, felt that he had returned again
to civilized regions. After inquiring his road, he
started off on foot, for he had no other way of
covering the long distance separating him from <em>la
Boca</em>.</p>

<p>As he went along he pondered his situation; and
doubt tormented him. Failure appeared constantly
in his path. For the hundredth time he went over
the confession Nacha had made to him in Julieta's
presence on the eve of her abduction. How could
she possibly fear being attracted by Arnedo, brutal
and tyrannous as he was? How, after several
months of an honest and decent life, could it be so
easy for her to go back to a vicious world? Yet
that was what her return to Arnedo meant. What
unfathomable depths, what mysteries there are in
human hearts! He could not believe that Nacha
had ceased to love him. She loved him, not only,
as she supposed, as a daughter loves her father, or
as a sister her brother, or a believer God: she loved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
him with her whole being. But Nacha must have
had her moments of doubt too, and it was then that
the memory of her life with Pampa, its violences
and its caresses, must have pursued her as Pampa
himself was doing; and her very honesty with herself
would in such a case make her feel ashamed,
and confirm her fears that she was destined to an
evil life.</p>

<p>He was following the river bank where old boats
lay sleeping. A sailor's chanty disturbed the silence.
Taverns, bearing exotic names that recalled all the
countries of the earth, lined the other side of the
street, and within, grimy men were drinking. Monsalvat
thought of his earlier years, of his travels,
of his sojourns in Italy, of the women who had
loved him, of his carefree and happy life. And
there he was, on his way back from a house of ill-fame,
fresh from the society of a thief, trudging
along in this wretched district, in search of a lost
woman! And he felt an immense pity for himself....</p>

<p>He asked a passer-by to direct him to the address
Gertrude had given him. It was not far from there.
With a good-bye to the river, which had summoned
before him some of his happiest memories, saddening
him withal, he set out for his destination.</p>

<p>Now he was passing through a street which had
on one side a high wall, possibly that of a cathedral,
or a convent, or perhaps merely that of a factory,
a black railing topping it; and now he was going
down another street lined with taverns, and Scandinavian
lodging houses. Monsalvat looked in
through some of the open doorways, his eye attracted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
by foreign wall decorations. In one of these
lodging places, the proprietor and his family were
entertaining the boarders. A small house, its balconies
full of potted flowers, rubbed shoulders with
a tightly closed hovel in front of which was a street
lamp bearing the legend "Fram." In another of
these taverns an old street-walker, wearing an extraordinary
assortment of garments, and ironically
enough preserving, even in her present decay, something
of the unusual, even noble beauty she had once
possessed, was amusing, with her drunken antics,
four tall, fair-haired and silent men who were evidently
sailors. Monsalvat passed on through another
street, shaded by a few trees; and the taverns
here, with their walls of one color, vivid blues, or
greens, suggested the decorations of Russian ballets.
Finally, among the shanties built on piles, because
of flood tides, and constructed of the cheapest sort
of wood, with tin roofs, he found the address Gertrude
had mentioned; for it was not fictitious.
Pushing open the door, he went in. No, Nacha
could not possibly be here. No one could be capable
of holding a woman prisoner in such a place.
Only the off-scourings of the human race could
frequent such a den as this! The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>, of large
proportions, opening into low-ceilinged rooms, was
roofed over. About fifty individuals, dirty and
ill-smelling, sat, or stood about, in groups. There
were even some negroes there, clearly North Americans.
No one was talking. Three or four women,
dressed in screaming red, were running about from
one group to another.... No! Nacha was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
there! And Monsalvat went away convinced that
he had been the victim of a brutal joke.</p>

<p>The following day, desperately anxious to find
Nacha, and save her from the fatal surroundings
into which she had probably fallen, he returned to
the house near the <em>Hospicio de la Merced</em>. By dint
of money he succeeded in interviewing Gertrude
alone. The girl, with admirable levity, laughed at
the trick she had played him. Then she tried to
put the blame on the youth who had led Monsalvat
into the ambush.</p>

<p>"And how is it you are living with a thief?" Monsalvat
inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't pry into other people's business!"</p>

<p>"But you know that he assaults people and robs
them?"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it? And what's that to you?"</p>

<p>After a long discussion and the promise of more
money if it proved that she had not deceived him
again, Monsalvat obtained the address he wanted.
It was that of a house of good appearance between
Lezama Park and la Boca; and it cost him a considerable
sum to get into it. At his request the
proprietress introduced all the girls who were there
at the moment. But Nacha was not among them.
One girl, however, turned out to have been a member
of the group who had been with Nacha in the
cabaret on the night he came to her defence. Monsalvat
took her aside. She was a fat, stupid-looking
creature, sniffling constantly.</p>

<p>"I saw you that night, you remember? And I
wanted to know you. What luck to meet you at
last, old fellow!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>This was very friendly treatment from a person
he had never spoken to before. Monsalvat explained
the object of his visit. The girl looked
disappointed, but gave him what information she
had.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything, you understand! But
I heard talk about something going on. One night
they brought a girl here, and kept her two days&mdash;but
I was away all that time. Then they took her
somewhere else. And you say it was Nacha? Who
would have thought it! And she was always so
stuck-up&mdash;to think of what's happened to her now!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat asked her to explain what she meant.</p>

<p>"Why they say that she was taken to one of
those houses&mdash;oh, the very worst! Somewhere in
Olavarría Street, or Necochea&mdash;I'm not sure which.
If you want to find her, go to those houses and
inquire."</p>

<p>Monsalvat started out again. Twice he had gone
down into this hell; he had never thought he would
have to descend to the very lowest circles of the
abyss. But for Nacha's sake he went even into
those ghastly caverns where lie the unhappy beings
who have lost not only their bodies, but their minds
and their souls too. And as he wandered among
the shades there&mdash;they could not be called living
beings&mdash;Monsalvat wondered how this last of all
crimes could be allowed in a world that also contains
beauty and kindness; for these women had been
degraded from the human estate to that of beasts.
And other human beings had allowed this to happen;
and still other human beings had caused it....</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XXI</h2>


<p>The quest through <em>la Boca</em> proved vain. No
one would give him any information. But he
was sent hither and yon, serving now as a joke and
now as a prey to robbers. He was always assured
that such and such an individual could no doubt tell
him what he wanted to know, and Monsalvat would
run this clue down, from café to café, from tavern
to tavern. In this fashion he traversed the entire
district of <em>la Boca</em>, that sinister "Tenderloin" of
Buenos Aires. He went to gaming houses, lupanars,
saloons. He entered cheap hotels and lodging
houses.</p>

<p>Here English or German phrases fell on his ear;
there he heard Norwegian, Russian, or Finnish. In
another quarter he found a medley of Balkan
tongues, and in yet another he recognized the barbarous
Arab dialects of Northern Africa. One day
he found himself at a Korean bar; on another in a
Chinese eating house. Once he made his way into
a gathering of Turks. In the course of one month
he encountered all kinds of people. A motley
throng of gamblers, down-and-outs, and criminals
passed before him: yet all was useless. He learned
nothing of Nacha.</p>

<p>He went back one afternoon to the house where
she had been kept a few days, and wondered why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
he had not thought of doing so before. Instead,
however, of questioning the girls, he interviewed
the proprietress in person, and offered to give her
a thousand <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> if she could provide him with
reliable information concerning Nacha's whereabouts.
The woman was an old creature full of
cunning and lies, hard to understand because of her
mumbling and her odd use of words. She was
smoking stubby cigars which she made herself, from
Paraguay tobacco. But the sum this caller offered
for a little information made her open her wrinkled
eyelids wide. She began to tell him all she knew.</p>

<p>It so happened also that she detested Pampa.
He had treated her badly on various occasions,
using her for the accomplishment of his crimes, and
then failing to pay for her services. With the help
of his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patota</i>, and Mauli, he had brought Nacha to
her house where she was kept locked up like a
prisoner. She would not allow any man to come
near her, however, screaming, scratching and biting
like a fury. Finally Arnedo, revolver in hand, made
her write to Monsalvat, thinking to tame her in
that way and show her how useless any resistance
was.</p>

<p>"How did she receive Arnedo's attentions?"
Monsalvat asked.</p>

<p>"You ought to have seen her!" the old woman
replied, drawing at her cigar butt. "She called him
names, just the way she did me, and everyone else
she could think of. What words she used! And
he didn't run after her much either! I guess he
brought her here to get even with someone. With
whom? How should I know, son?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you don't know where Nacha is?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She's...."</p>

<p>She moved her cigar stump to the other side of
her mouth.</p>

<p>"See here, young man, if you put down fifty
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> of that thousand now, I'll give you a pretty
little piece of information. True as I'm telling you!
This old body wouldn't lie! I was raised to speak
the truth, and I'll die doing the same!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat handed her the sum she asked, and
the old creature gave him two bits of advice. He
was to talk to a certain Amiral, a poor wretch who
was a friend of Arnedo's, and who, for money,
would get the truth out of Pampa. However, the
other, and the better course to follow, in her opinion,
was to see a washerwoman named Braulia, who
knew all the vicious resorts of the district for she
kept them "stocked" with girls.</p>

<p>Braulia proved to be a negress, who lived in a
shanty, at the back of a vacant lot. After much
chattering she told him that she would answer his
question the following night, when he was to meet
her at a certain café, on the river bank. Fearing
a decoy, for he had learned to be mistrustful, he
asked her why he could not wait on the street corner,
or in some café he knew. The negress replied
that he would have to go where she told him, and
if that didn't suit him he could go without what he
was looking for.</p>

<p>The next evening he went to the café designated.
His entrance there appeared not to attract attention.
As a matter of fact its patrons had instantly spotted
him, but they pretended not to notice his presence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
The place was a foul den, much like a cave, so low
was its roof. The chairs, benches and tables were
greasy and ill-smelling. A mulatto in his shirt-sleeves
was waiting on the customers. Three North
American negroes, so drunk they could not stand,
were singing something with a cakewalk rhythm.
Opening their mouths wide, they stretched their
thick lips from ear to ear, showing their red gums
and gleaming white teeth. One of them was playing
a large accordion. From the table where Monsalvat
was sitting he could see the port light of a
boat, and above, the starry sky. Every few minutes
a drunken man staggered up the street.</p>

<p>While he was waiting for some message from
the negress, a man came up to him, and, telling him
he belonged to the secret police, advised him to
leave. "This is no place for you," he said. "Whoever
it was told you to come here is just planning
to rob you." Monsalvat left the place, and never
returned to it.</p>

<p>He decided to see Amiral; but this turned out to
be more easily planned than done. Amiral apparently
never ate at home and rarely slept there; and
it was of course useless to write to him since he was
quite likely to show the communication to Arnedo.
So, while trying to find the elusive Amiral, Monsalvat
continued his seeking of Nacha. He was
beginning now to absent himself from his office for
entire afternoons. List in hand, he went about
stirring up all the back waters of this dismal slough
of despond.</p>

<p>"She is not here. We don't know her," they
would tell him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he would go to another house, and another,
and yet another. He would explain his object,
argue with the unfriendly "Madames," give countless
details about Nacha. At times he begged for
help; but at others, he would become enraged and
insult the woman who told him "She is not here."
Exasperated, maddened, he would rush out and
stumble into the first taxi that passed, giving addresses
of yet other houses. For he could think
of nothing but this purpose. He came to the point
of believing that everyone was in league to outwit
him. But he would succeed yet! He had one irresistible
ally: the will to find her!</p>

<p>"She is not here. We don't know her."</p>

<p>"What? Not here either?" Then the earth
must have swallowed her! They all knew nothing
about her, these people? That was a lie! They
wanted to lead him on, exploit him, as they had
done countless times. There was nothing but lies
and hypocrisy and evil in these women. And he
had defended them, ruined himself for them! Ah,
Nacha! Nacha! What had her unhappy destiny
brought her to? She asked him not to look for
her, since she was destined to a bad life! But all
the more would he persist, with all the more eagerness,
all the more desperation! He would seek
her, not for love, but to save her from those stagnant
waters on whose brim ill-fated women and
girls lurched and staggered, dizzy with the poisonous
gases of that loathsome morass!</p>

<p>"She is not here. We don't know her."</p>

<p>Every word fell on him like a whip-lash. He
would come out of these accursed houses, sick, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
physical pain; and he could not grow used to disappointments.
At first his heart had been high with
hope. But now his step was beginning to falter,
and a strange expression had come over his face.
His eyes glanced nervously about at people and
objects in the room, or stared at the woman he was
questioning. He knew that she too would say,
"She is not here." Yet he went on to the next
house and to the next, repeating his frantic question.
Then, almost invariably, without a word more
he would rush out; though once, to the stupefaction
of the women, he uttered an exclamation of anguish,
and staggered to a chair.</p>

<p>"She is not here. We don't know her," was the
unvarying reply.</p>

<p>At the thought that she might be dead his throat
tightened and closed, while the rest of his body
felt the oppression as of a great weight of earth
upon it. Nacha dead! What was he to do in a
world without Nacha? Should he return to the
place he had formerly occupied in life? Or consecrate
himself to those other wretches of the underworld?
But then Nacha could not have died without
his feeling it, without his knowing it! No,
Nacha could not be dead! She was alive! She
loved him! She was waiting for him!</p>

<p>"She is not here. We don't know her."</p>

<p>Well, didn't he know that Nacha wasn't there?
Nacha loved him, and was expecting him, somewhere.
That much was sure! If he had come to
this particular house to inquire it was merely to be
thorough. The people there could all go to the
devil for all he cared! He wasn't going to ask
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
any favors of them! Nacha was waiting for him....
What did the rest of the world matter ...
society, or its victims, or the cabaret, or the workmen
murdered in the Square, or his mother's death,
or his sister's! Nacha was expecting him! His
heart, where a sweet, incessant song was singing,
leapt, mad with joy, like the throbbing breast of a
bird! Nacha was expecting him....</p>

<p>But where?</p>

<p>Meanwhile Monsalvat was not altogether unmindful
of himself. He noticed that at times his
mind became blank, and that at such moments he
would turn deathly pale, and be unable to walk.
Then again he suffered from pains at the base of
his brain, as if a wedge had been hammered into
his skull at that point. He wondered if this presaged
mental derangement. Was he going mad?
He ate next to nothing, and slept little. Worried
about his condition, he spent a week in bed.</p>

<p>One afternoon a letter came from the Ministry.
It contained his dismissal. Monsalvat read the
document, smiling. With it was a letter from the
under-secretary who expressed his chief's regrets
at being forced to take such action; but Monsalvat's
frequent absences from the office, his lack of attention
to his work, which, of course, might result in
serious consequences, left the Minister no choice in
the matter.</p>

<p>Monsalvat tossed both communications to the
floor. "What does such nonsense matter to me?
Nacha is waiting for me!"</p>

<p>The "nonsense," nevertheless, had serious implications.
November was upon him and he had paid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
only a third of the interest on the mortgage. The
Bank was insisting on payment, but he had no
idea where to get the three thousand <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> needed.
Moreover he was constantly giving away more
than he could possibly afford, and naïvely letting
himself be robbed on every hand. He had borrowed
at high rates and had never paid any of the
accumulating interest. The Bank, however, came
to his rescue by selling the tenement, obtaining
scarcely sixty thousand at the auction, which occurred
on an oppressive November day. Very few
bidders appeared; for it was just the beginning of
that financial crisis which was to come to a head
some fifteen months later, in 1913. Property values
were going down. Money stringency was acute.
No one was risking investment in real estate except
at a bargain. The Bank recovered its forty thousand
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> with the interest. Monsalvat paid his
minor borrowings and in the end found himself
possessed of some ten thousand <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i>. He now
felt quite at ease. On that sum he could live two
years in case he found no work. But it was written
that bad luck was to pursue him. The bank in
which he deposited his money failed within three
months!</p>

<p>He met Amiral one morning, and, without preamble,
told him that he wanted him to find out
from Arnedo, as skillfully as possible, where Nacha
was. Amiral, at mention of this name, smiled
understandingly. He stroked his long brown mustache,
and stretching out his thin arms, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Just what I always said! Of course a man like
you who has lived in Paris&mdash;why, when they told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
me you were trying to reform our girls over here,
I wouldn't believe them, for I felt sure you knew
better.... Well, I'm glad to see I was right!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat wanted to knock the fellow down but
contained himself. Amiral, thoroughly pleased with
his penetration, added, in a confidential tone:</p>

<p>"It was clever of you to think of this disguise;
because here in Buenos Aires, alas! there is no
atmosphere.... One has to provide it ... ha!
ha! ... provide it!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat wasted no time trying to correct
Amiral's interpretation of his conduct, but with
brutal directness offered him a thousand <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> to
find out where Nacha was. Amiral staggered back
dramatically. He thought that it perhaps became
him to be angry; but, having consulted his conscience,
he decided to accept. There was no need of being
offended for so small a sum! Had it been fifty or
a hundred thousand...!</p>

<p>Several days passed. Monsalvat was frightened
by a rapid change for the worse in his nervous condition.
One afternoon as he was drinking some
coffee in a pastry shop near the business centre of
the town, the mental blankness he knew and dreaded
came upon him. His hands trembled, and he broke
into a cold sweat. A waiter helped him into a cab.
When he reached his room he found he could neither
read nor write. His mind seemed scattered, broken
into bits. All his strength was gone. From day
to day his organism seemed to lose coordination,
as if all the parts of his being had escaped the
control of his will. Different men seemed to manifest
themselves within him; as he wonderingly observed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
them, he found the acts and thoughts of these
other Monsalvats quite inexplicable.</p>

<p>Finally, one December morning, Amiral told him
that Arnedo knew nothing about Nacha. After
keeping her several days locked up in a certain
house, he had taken her to another, from which,
after a week or two, she had run away.</p>

<p>Monsalvat believed her lost forever. At the
same time he was astonished at the slight impression
Amiral's words seemed to make on him. He
stood motionless for a long time gazing blankly into
the distance, but he felt so ill that he yielded to a
desire to go to some friend. He called on de
Castro, preferring not to see Torres, who might
think him either sick or insane. Ruiz was profoundly
distressed at sight of him. Monsalvat noticed
his friend's pitying expression and stammered
some incoherent words. Then he collapsed.</p>

<p>A deep, painful night had settled on him, body
and soul, nor could his mind see in that sudden
darkness. His whole being had become insensible.
For him now there was no longer either Nacha or
Monsalvat; nor struggling nor rest; for him there
was neither truth or beauty; the world had been
blotted out.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XXII</h2>


<p>The storm had passed. Calm had returned to
the world.</p>

<p>Monsalvat was living in a sanatorium at Almagro,
to which his friends had taken him. Tranquil
and silent, he spent nearly the entire day in the
small park, with its lofty eucalyptus groves, thinking
of nothing, trying not to think. He was new-born.
What did the past matter? He was going to look
ahead! Life lay before, not behind, him! Even
Nacha no longer existed; or rather, had ceased to
exist for him! With her, a whole universe&mdash;all
that he knew and loved, all that his feelings and
thought had created in him&mdash;had vanished from
his heart and mind. Not that he denied the reality
of the past year; but, the storm weathered, he found
himself looking at a new world, and he could not
live in its presence with the same opinions and
feelings as before.</p>

<p>Peace had come to him; but he lacked something
that he loved even more than peace: freedom; and
now that he felt sane and sound, he wanted to escape
from his present surroundings. Moreover, two
inoffensive maniacs had recently come to the sanatorium.
Their presence annoyed Monsalvat, for
he could not see that they differed very much from
himself. At times he wondered if his attempts to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
reform the world might not become a mania also,
and bring him down to the level of these harmless
lunatics.</p>

<p>His friends came but rarely to see him, for the
sanatorium was a little distance out of town. Their
consciences were clear since they were paying Monsalvat's
expenses.</p>

<p>One afternoon, however, after Monsalvat's complete
recovery, Ruiz de Castro and Torres called
on him. They sat in the garden, talking and for
the first time since his illness, touched on the forbidden
subject. Monsalvat had perhaps led them
on, by confiding to them his curious sensation of
having just come to life, as fresh and new as a new-born
baby. With a view to determining his friend's
actual state of mind, Torres observed:</p>

<p>"So you see how useless all those efforts of yours
really are...."</p>

<p>"Not at all," Monsalvat declared. "It is never
useless to try to help people."</p>

<p>"Granted that you help others," de Castro broke
in, "just the same, you did yourself a lot of harm!"</p>

<p>"You are quite mistaken. I have done myself a
great deal of good&mdash;so much good that today I am
not the discontented, dejected man I was a year
ago. I don't know what I shall do tomorrow; but
I know that if I am really a different man, I shall
owe the transformation to my idealistic view of
life."</p>

<p>"So you're going right on with that fool business!"
Torres exclaimed. "I fail to see the new man in
you. On the contrary, I should say your trouble is
that life doesn't teach you anything. After a year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
of failure&mdash;failure in every sense of the word&mdash;you
are still planning to reform the world, and all
by yourself!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat was silent a moment. Then he answered
calmly:</p>

<p>"It is life&mdash;not my failures, because I didn't fail&mdash;that
has taught me how powerless individual
effort is. I believe now that not only would I fail
to reform the world, but also that a million men
setting about it each on his own hook, as I did, would
fail too."</p>

<p>"Well, at last!" exclaimed Ruiz de Castro. "It's
about time you became convinced that the world
can't be changed."</p>

<p>"I didn't say that. On the contrary I consider
it more capable of reform now than ever it was.
But I also know that a program is necessary, and
a method, and training! I know now that the idealism
of one individual, the action of one man, does
not help much to bring about ultimate success. But
I do not go back on individual ideals, individual
accomplishment; because it is the individual who
provides the impulse, the forward push, the motive
power, if you like, without which nothing can move.
The only trouble is that all these energies are isolated,
uncoordinated.... However, you see my
point: before you can have action to accomplish a
purpose, you must have a vision of what the purpose
is. The ideal precedes and accompanies the accomplishment
of reform&mdash;that you understand! The
world must be reformed, must be built up again
rather, from its foundations. We must go about
such a matter slowly&mdash;but not too slowly&mdash;and so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
little by little...! But every so often the idealist,
the dreamer, the madman and the fool, all those
who fight the great battle with their hearts, must
give a vigorous thrust forward!"</p>

<p>His two friends looked at one another.... A
hopeless case!</p>

<p>"But why so many reforms in the world? Just
so that you can marry a prostitute?" Torres brutally
rejoined.</p>

<p>Monsalvat did not reply; and the doctor,
ashamed of his outbreak, tried to make up for it
by a show of affection. Monsalvat sat beside him
on a bench; and as Torres went on to trivial matters,
he patted his patient on the shoulder now and then.</p>

<p>After a while they went away, none too well
pleased. Monsalvat saw plainly that everything
about him&mdash;his opinions, his recent life, his feelings&mdash;were
compromising these friends of his. They
were kindly and relatively generous fellows, but he
knew that they were weak in the presence of social
pressure. However much they might care for him,
if they should have to choose between him and
society, they would without question side with the
latter.</p>

<p>The moment this became clear to him, he thought
of nothing but of making his escape. He did not
want his friends to know where he was going. If
he was compromising them he would spare them
the trouble and the annoyance of having to desert
him. He would desert them. He would rather
appear ungrateful than accept the unpleasant situation
which is bound to arise when people want to
cut a friendship short, and have not the courage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
to do it. Monsalvat wished to be free also; free,
not economically,&mdash;for he could earn a living somehow&mdash;but
free from those friends who constituted
the only bond still tying him to society.</p>

<p>One day he fled from the sanatorium. As he
possessed only the clothes he was wearing and his
pockets were empty, he walked from Almagro to
the capital. It was dawn when he started out. The
limpid sky deepened into a blue which still showed
a few stars. In the streets the shadows were slowly
drawing back into such retreats as the trees offered,
hanging veil-like about their trunks and branches,
and in the distance, out towards the harbor, a delicate
rose light had risen to view. What an extraordinary
sensation, this first contact with living things,
after months of isolation! How innocent life
seemed, and young! Oh, surely, the world was
new, it had been born again!</p>

<p>Passing along the solitary streets, he lived in his
dream, feeling neither cold nor fatigue. Everything
had been made over. The sky was clearer than
before, objects had an unknown beauty, men were
living in harmony.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to him that so it must always
seem to one who wanders alone under a sky, and
amid colors that offer love to a world awakening
to the day; and then he remembered that of all men,
only the humble of the earth see this dawn-light,
and carry something of its tenderness in their hearts.
Was it this, perhaps, which kept them from noticing
the approach of another dawn, already sending its
heralds across the sky?</p>

<p>He had left the tree-bordered avenues now. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
city was awakening. Poor folk, laborers for the
most part, passed him now at every step. House
doors were opening. The deep blue of the sky had
given place to a luminous clarity, and the world was
rosy for a moment, enveloped in a shining softness.
Then the sun rose, and morning filled with sounds
and lights, joys and sorrows. Life! Monsalvat
took a deep breath; for it seemed that with this air
he breathed in freedom too. He felt that he was
sound and good.</p>

<p>But suddenly fatigue overtook him. He tried to
distance it, but in vain. It hung on his legs, weighting
down his body, making it hard for him to walk.
When he reached the Plaza del Once he sat down
on a bench, and rested there for an hour, dozing a
little. Then he began to consider his situation.
Where should he go? First of all he must find
lodgings. In a miserable hotel on the Plaza, they
refused to give him a room because he had no luggage;
and be met with the same refusal in other
cheap inns. So the morning passed. Finally he
bethought him of a Spaniard whose wife kept a
boarding house on the Plaza Lavalle, and for whom
he had once done a favor; so he set out for this
address.</p>

<p>It was already past noon and he began to feel
the pangs of hunger. He tried to pass quickly by
the Court buildings in the Plaza Lavalle, anxious
to escape the notice of his former colleagues. But
suddenly, as he was crossing the street, he saw in
front of him a shabbily dressed individual who was
bowing to him with exaggerated servility. It was
none other than Moreno, still haunting the courts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
in quest of copying to do, or errands to run. Monsalvat
inquired after his wife and Irene.</p>

<p>"Oh, Doctor, misfortune has taken possession of
my hearth and home! Irene&mdash;but why speak of
past troubles? Some other time, Doctor, I'll tell you
this melancholy story. Now we are struggling, with
a little success, I may say, against the cruel persecutions
of the Fates. My wife has a position as
janitress in a tenement house. It's a little distance
out, over Barracas way, near the bridge. But we
manage to keep alive."</p>

<p>As he went on talking it occurred to Monsalvat
that he had found a solution for his problem. He
asked Moreno if there were any unoccupied rooms
in the house he spoke of.</p>

<p>"Yes, Doctor, there are. But why this question?"</p>

<p>"Because I wish to take one of them at once."</p>

<p>Moreno stood open-mouthed with astonishment.
Then he protested in a welter of words. He could
never permit Doctor Monsalvat, that light of the
Law, to live in the wretched hovel which he inhabited.
Monsalvat, however, insisted that that was
his affair. Moreno concluded that Monsalvat had
chosen that section of the city to carry out some kind
of philanthropical scheme, and consented to take
him home. Besides, he was sure to profit eventually
by Monsalvat's presence in the same house!
A <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peso</i> here and there, for a quiet little session
in a saloon now and then, to say nothing of the
pretexts he could find for borrowing&mdash;urgent creditors,
need of clothing, food, and so on!</p>

<p>Moreno was giving his address when some words
of Monsalvat's thrust him into unfathomable depths
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
of bewilderment. The doctor was actually asking
him for carfare! Moreno stood transfixed, his
arms outspread, a look of terror on his sallow face.</p>

<p>"You're surely joking, Doctor!" he exclaimed,
incredulous. "Can it be that Moreno, poor pariah
that he is, Moreno, stepson of Providence, should
be asked to lend a&mdash;a nickel&mdash;to the learned and
illustrious Doctor Fernando Monsalvat?"</p>

<p>He looked at his admired protector and saw that
now, at least, the man was not to be envied. He
was on the point of taking back what he had said
about a room to let in his tenement house. Finally,
in a burst of generosity, he took a dime from his
pocket and gave it to Monsalvat. As the latter
walked away, Moreno stood a full quarter of an
hour, his arms crossed on his chest, meditating and
philosophizing on the vicissitudes of human destiny.</p>

<p>Monsalvat took up his abode in the tenement.
He wrote to his father's wife, suggesting a cash
compromise for the rights to his father's property
that he might claim from the surmised existence of
an early will, rights that Ruiz de Castro had always
urged him to assert. As long as he had enough
to live on, he had seen no reason why he should
claim any of the Monsalvat property. His letter
was modest in its tone, intimating that only a distressing
financial situation could have persuaded
him to bring up the question of his father's testamentary
provisions. Moreno delivered the letter.</p>

<p>His father's wife had never been kindly disposed
toward him, had in fact injured him in every way
she could. Determined that her daughters should
know nothing of their father's illegitimate family,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
she had never permitted him even to meet his half-sisters.
They had been led to believe that Fernando
Monsalvat was a distant relative. The letter itself
remained unanswered; but its recipient sent back a
fifty <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peso</i> bill. Money meant nothing to Monsalvat
and, always slow to perceive bad intentions
in others, he did not catch the offensive tone of the
reply. On the contrary, he acknowledged the remittance
in cordial fashion, and felt quite happy
about having received it. He purchased a few
articles of clothing, paid his rent, and rewarded
Moreno for his services. During the next month
he lived on the good will of Moreno's wife, who
let him stay on without paying, telling the landlord
that the room occupied by her protégé was without
a tenant. She also saw to it that he had something
to eat, giving him whatever was left over from her
own table; and that was little enough.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he wrote articles and sent them out
to newspapers and periodicals. He was convinced
that he now had something to say, and decided
henceforth to give his energies to writing. One
review accepted an article, sending him thirty <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i>,
which he at once handed over to his protectress.</p>

<p>Two months passed, two strange months during
which he lived indoors, entirely shut up within himself,
far from everyone and everything. Often he
spent the day in bed, talking only to Moreno, who
frequently came to provide him with conversation.
More than once the man recalled Irene's tragic
story; but Monsalvat listened to it with interest
every time, stirred by the curious spectacle of this
father, who in telling of his daughter's sufferings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
lost something of his absurdity; and not unmindful
of the part he himself had played in the girl's
unhappy life.</p>

<p>According to Moreno, Irene had fallen in love
with someone who could not share her passion; as
a result she had for several weeks been crazed with
grief. At the slightest provocation she would fly
into a rage, threaten her mother, insult Moreno,
attack the children. Then a suitor presented himself,
a young man who worked in a barber-shop
near by. He was an ugly, dark-skinned, almost
grotesque fellow; but Irene accepted him, no one
knew why, for plainly she cared nothing for him.
However, someone in the neighborhood told her
that her betrothed had a mistress. As a matter of
fact he had put an end to these relations; but Irene,
humiliated, hurt and angered by the deception, went
out of her head, called a man in from the street,
told him what had happened, and offered herself to
him. Her suitor heard gossip of the incident,
rushed to Irene's room, and tried to shoot her. He
missed his aim, was arrested, tried, and imprisoned.
Then Irene ran away. All that Moreno could discover
about her after that was that every week
she visited the fellow at the prison. How she made
a living, he did not know.</p>

<p>"She's lost, doctor, lost!" Moreno would sob.
"The flower of the family! So good, and such a
worker&mdash;as pretty as they make them! And to
think that I am the guilty one, I, most contemptible
of drunkards! There you see the consequences of
vice&mdash;for my poor little girl is the child of alcohol!
That's why she turned out as she did&mdash;my fault!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>And he covered his unwashed face with his two
hands, and occupied Monsalvat's only chair while
the latter dressed.</p>

<p>One day Monsalvat decided to go out. He had
just put on a summer overcoat&mdash;directly over his
shirt, for his jacket and waistcoat he had pawned&mdash;when
Moreno's wife came in to announce some
ladies who were asking to see him. He looked
sternly at the woman. He was sure she had reported
the sad case of "the poor fellow starving
on the top floor" to some charitable society! He
went out to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> resolved to pay no attention
to the ladies.</p>

<p>Noisy outcries were coming from one of the
rooms&mdash;a woman's voice cursing these charity visitors
who had refused her any help, because she
had a child and wasn't married, and screaming
denunciations of charity organizations in general
and of the poor wretches who toadied to these fine
ladies so as to get money out of them. The visitors
seemed neither angered nor intimidated. Evidently
they were accustomed to such scenes.</p>

<p>"Is what that woman says true?" asked Monsalvat.</p>

<p>"Why I know you!" exclaimed the other&mdash;the
plump lady who, at a dinner at Ruiz de Castro's,
had been so oratorical in her defense of the established
order.</p>

<p>Monsalvat shook hands coldly with both ladies.
They tried to conceal the surprise and pain his
obviously distressful circumstances caused them.</p>

<p>"Is what that woman says true?" Monsalvat inquired
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Monsalvat, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paid no attention to Isabel's excuses.</p>

<p>"Then this woman is quite right. You have no
charity in you. You are doing this kind of thing
for selfish motives, and nothing else&mdash;just to occupy
your time, fill conspicuous positions in charity organizations!"</p>

<p>Launched on this theme, he drove harshly,
savagely ahead, as though executing judgment.
Wrapped in his overcoat which was too loose for
him, now and then moving his shoulders in a gesture
of scorn, his eyes wide open, and seemingly
larger so emaciated was his face, he presented an
extraordinary spectacle as he denounced these stylish,
distinguished, perfumed ladies, so out of place
in that dreary courtyard of the slums. They listened
to him without a word. Isabel, indeed, unnoticed
by Monsalvat, softly stole from the group
and went up to the woman whose outcries had
started the scene, giving her all the money she had
in her purse. Nor did Monsalvat observe that
when she returned she removed a glove and took
a ring from her finger. Suddenly, and quite humbly
she said:</p>

<p>"Here, Monsalvat, take this, please sell it; and
give the money to this woman."</p>

<p>Monsalvat took the ring.</p>

<p>"And if you&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked at him fearful of offending: he was
shaking his head. Drawing him aside, she began
to talk with him more in confidence.</p>

<p>"You need to, Monsalvat! Please accept part
of the ring's value! We all have to live. Don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
think us so bad&mdash;When I spoke as I did that night,
you remember, it was because I knew nothing about
life&mdash;I too have suffered since then, and now I
understand many things...."</p>

<p>Though Monsalvat was unyielding on this point,
he shook hands with his callers in far more friendly
fashion, and left the building accompanied by Moreno,
who could not get over his amazement at what
was going on before his eyes. He did not lose
much time before offering, unsuccessfully, to sell the
ring himself. Monsalvat saw that as a matter of
fact these two women like many others of their
class were not thoroughly bad as he had believed.
If they appeared to disadvantage it was because
of the atmosphere of gross selfishness in which they
had been brought up, in which they had lived all
their lives. The bad in them was not an individual
thing inherent in their characters, but the result of
prevailing ideas, the collective product of a self-satisfied
and unintelligent, rather than unfeeling,
society.</p>

<p>They took a street-car going towards the business
section of the city. Monsalvat was glad of Moreno's
company; for a sudden fit of weakness had
come over him. He had scarcely been able to walk
the three blocks to the car line, so unsteady were
his legs under him. In the tram he felt quite nauseated.
Houses and sidewalks were being pushed
by some mysterious force out of their true plane,
and were rising, sinking, retreating. The car was
crowded. Moreno moved forward to find a seat,
leaving Monsalvat sitting in the rear of the tram.</p>

<p>They were passing through Piedras Street. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
the corner of Méjico, the man beside him rose to
give his place to a woman. Monsalvat did not look
at her, merely noticing that she was in mourning.
In a few moments, however, he felt that she was
looking at him. An acquaintance perhaps who had
recognized him! And he grew uneasily conscious
of his bedraggled appearance. Then he reflected
that with his week's growth of beard and his thread-bare
coat, his startling emaciation, his whole air
of weakness and sickness, he must be quite secure.
No one would know him. The thought consoled
him, but he turned carelessly towards the window,
so as to hide his face.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a soft voice murmuring his
name. He turned pale, and his hands began to
tremble. A whole row of houses plunged several
yards into the ground, changing color as they sank.
The car seemed to lurch to one side threatening to
fall over on itself.</p>

<p>"It's so long since we have seen one another,"
the voice was saying. "My mother died, and I am
living in Tacuarí Street, in our boarding house. I
have been there some time. My sister runs the
house&mdash;and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Monsalvat had regained a more normal state of
consciousness, but he said nothing. He could not
speak. Nacha's voice was like a music infinitely
sweet, echoing in his ears as in a delicious dream,
something vague and hazy like a memory from a
past beyond any but the vaguest sort of remembering....</p>

<p>Finally he looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>In his stained clothing, in his pitiful weakness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Nacha read his tragic story at a glance. Here was
a sick man! His eyes had lost the keenness they
once possessed. They were faded and glazed, apparently
incapable of concentrating on any object.</p>

<p>As the car crossed the Avenida de Mayo a fellow
of very ordinary appearance, apparently a rustic,
came up to Nacha and touched her on the shoulder.
She introduced him to Monsalvat.</p>

<p>"We are to be married soon," she said. "I met
him in the boarding house where I live. We are
going to the country, to his ranch&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nacha's fiancé was looking at Monsalvat with
evident mistrust, and showed his impatience to get
off the car.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" asked Nacha, as they were
leaving.</p>

<p>"Where do I live?" he exclaimed, as though that
were the most singular of inquiries.</p>

<p>Then he grew pale again; and again his hands
began to tremble.</p>

<p>"I want you to be a witness at our marriage,"
she pleaded as she pressed his hand with a tenderness
he could not remember ever to have felt before.</p>

<p>"Come, come, we must be going!" the fiancé protested
with ill-concealed annoyance.</p>

<p>"You can't refuse, Monsalvat. Please! Be good
to me for this last time&mdash;Tell me where you live!"</p>

<p>Monsalvat heard a voice giving his address.</p>

<p>"He lives in my house, Madame. I am Moreno,
the attorney, at your service. I consider myself a
faithful friend of this illustrious gentleman. I belong
to the ancient family of the Morenos of Chivilcoy;
and though the unkind Fates...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsalvat no longer felt the pressure of that
warm hand.</p>

<p>Nacha, on the arm of her future husband, had
stepped down from the car.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>


<p>Arnedo kept her locked up in first one house
and then another, and Nacha's hatred of him
grew until the intensity of her feeling frightened
her. Such hate as this threatened to swallow up
all other feelings, to absorb her utterly in itself, poisoning
and destroying her. If she had been attracted
to him before he carried her off, it was because she
believed that he desired her. When she discovered,
however, that his abduction of her was not for love,
but for vengeance, to get even with Monsalvat;
when she saw that he was actuated by something
evil in him, which he could not have changed even
though he had wanted to, she began to think of him
as something monstrous and diabolical. He was the
savage with no rôle to play in civilization, powerless&mdash;save
for evil!</p>

<p>In the first prison he put her in she saw him only
once, on the occasion when, pointing a revolver at
her, he forced her to write the letter which was to
be a final blow at Monsalvat. The effect of this
incident on Nacha had been to rouse in her profound
pity for the man she was so wounding. Again she
was causing him suffering! She imagined him
searching for her through all the dreary reaches of
the city; and her constant thinking of him always
brought her to one conclusion; for her, happiness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
could consist only in offering up her whole being in
sacrifice for this man!</p>

<p>The owners of both houses had presented her
to their best patrons. Nacha, frantic with rage, had
driven them out of her presence. She was determined
to escape and threatened to get the police.
But so close was the watch kept over her that she
could not even get a letter into the mail-box. In
the second house she was sent to she made friends
with one of the girls, the unfortunate daughter of
an English drunkard whose stepmother had driven
her away from home. Nacha, through Laura's
help, succeeded in having her case brought to the
attention of two men who frequented the house on
Laura's account. One of them, an influential lawyer,
informed the police of the situation and Nacha was
given her freedom. Pampa would have gone to
prison if Nacha had not refused to admit that she
knew who was responsible for her abduction.</p>

<p>Nacha was taken from this house to the police
station, to state her case. The lawyer talked to
her awhile; and, when he understood her situation,
offered her money, and asked her what she was
going to do.</p>

<p>"What can I do, sir? Follow my destiny...."</p>

<p>"Your destiny? That word doesn't mean anything.
Every one makes his own destiny. You
ought to go back to your mother's."</p>

<p>"They won't take me back!"</p>

<p>"Very well then. I'll go see them and settle the
matter."</p>

<p>Nacha meanwhile lived in the house where Julieta
was lodged. Together the two girls went to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
tenement where Nacha had been living, to get her
furniture and clothes. Although the room had been
rented to someone else the caretaker very humbly
and sanctimoniously collected half a month's rent
from them, saying that Nacha would have to pay
storage on her things before she could have them.
She inquired for Monsalvat and learned that he
had gone away. A few days later the lawyer told
Nacha that she could return to her home. Her
mother had died, and her sister, Catalina, was running
the house.</p>

<p>Her sister received her with the indifference she
might have shown to a stranger. When she found
herself in her childhood home, Nacha could have
wept, so many were the scenes that passed again
through her memory. She thought of her absent
mother, and of her meeting in that very house with
Riga! But her sister's abrupt manner, assumed to
conceal her feelings, Nacha believed&mdash;restrained
her.</p>

<p>"When did&mdash;it happen?" asked Nacha.</p>

<p>"A month ago."</p>

<p>"Did she speak of me? Did she forgive me before
she died?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And she asked me to look for you. But
I scarcely knew where to find you."</p>

<p>This implied an effort which Catalina, as a matter
of fact, had never made; nor had she any intention
of looking for her sister. Her hope was that Nacha
would never turn up, that she would thus be left in
undisturbed possession of her mother's house. Soon
after Nacha's disappearance, Cata had married a
fellow quite inferior to her own station. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
mother had been much offended at the match and
refused to see Cata, choosing to consider her as
completely lost as Nacha. But when the husband
died, her mother consented to have her return to
live with her. The property left the two daughters
consisted of a small house in Liniers and the furnishings
of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pensión</i>&mdash;some thirty thousand
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> all told.</p>

<p>Nacha found her sister much changed. Ten years
earlier Cata had been a lively and not unattractive
young person. Now she was slow in movement and
heavy, and as she was very short, there was nothing
graceful about her figure. In the old days, although
they squabbled a great deal, the sisters had managed
to get along together. But Cata's disposition
had soured, though her ill-temper could not have
been guessed from her fair-skinned and pretty face.
Nacha noticed this change with alarm. How could
she have become so bitter, and sharp-tongued, when
she had once been so cheerful? What made her
sister so envious and jealous, and full of petty meanness?</p>

<p>Nacha settled down in the house. She rarely
went out, because she did not want to arouse suspicions
in her sister. She helped with the multitudinous
tasks of the household, and little by little
took on all the work, as Cata skillfully disengaged
herself from it. With the students and other men
boarders Nacha's dealings were of the briefest.
She barely spoke to them, so fearful was she of
having Cata doubt her intentions of being an honest
woman.</p>

<p>But it was written that Nacha must suffer in every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
relationship. Cata was constantly spying upon her.
If Nacha stopped a moment in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> to exchange
a few words with a boarder, her sister would eye
her suspiciously and take up a position somewhere
near at hand, so as to observe her. Nacha could
not discuss the most trifling matter with her sister
without hearing allusions to her past life. If they
happened to be commenting on some one of the
boarders, such as, for instance, the desirability of
giving the preference to one student instead of another,
in the question of terms, Cata would grow
impatient.</p>

<p>"Of course, you must be right. You have known
so many men...."</p>

<p>Nacha might have borne such jibes in private.
But her sister often got them off at table in front
of everyone. Some of the boarders would laugh.
Others felt secretly sorry for Nacha. Once, when
Nacha did not eat what was on the plate before
her, Cata asked:</p>

<p>"Doesn't this fare suit you? I suppose at the
famous houses that you are used to living in, they
had better cooks."</p>

<p>She was no more successful in finding happiness
in other quarters. At first she had searched persistently
for Monsalvat but had not obtained the
slightest news of him. Torres or Ruiz de Castro
could, she believed, have told her where he was,
but she did not care to see either of these men.
She remembered how Torres had lied to her, telling
her that Monsalvat was in love with another woman.
She had no reason to believe that he would not lie
to her again. In Torres' opinion, as doubtless in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Ruiz de Castro's, she was to blame for Monsalvat's
situation; she was an enemy, to be kept at a distance!
Nevertheless, as the months went by and
her anxiety concerning him increased, she went one
day to Torres' office, and with tears in her eyes
asked for news of her friend. Torres told her the
truth. Monsalvat had been very ill, had fled from
the sanatorium, and no one had the slightest idea
where he was. Nacha, however, believed that
Torres was trying to put her off, and left after
reproaching him for his past cruelty towards her.</p>

<p>One morning there arrived at the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pensión</i> a
boarder who seemed startlingly out of place in that
student boarding house. He was a corpulent fellow,
heavy-shouldered, slow-moving, with enormous
hands, and short fat fingers. His face was not
altogether ugly: the features were large and firmly
cut, and as immobile as though carved in oakwood.
On the day of his arrival he wore riding breeches
and boots. He spoke rarely, as though he feared
his voice might sound too loud; but he burst into
great shouts of laughter at the nonsensical stories
with which the students regaled the dinner-table.
Cata found out all there was to learn about his life.
He was rich&mdash;owned a ranch in Pergamino&mdash;and
had come to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pensión</i> because it had been recommended
to him by one of the students who worked
as one of his hands during the holidays. Little did
he suspect that the young man in question had congratulated
himself on thus providing his fellow students
with excellent first-hand material for their
amusement! Cata, however, would not allow the
slightest disrespect to this "native" of whom she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
made a protégé. By good-natured jokes at the
beginning of their acquaintance, followed by maternal
advice, Cata succeeded in bringing about certain
changes in his attire, and modifying some of his
rustic habits. The fellow was a good sort at bottom,
and lent himself willingly to Cata's polishing,
much to the amazement both of Nacha and the
students who wondered what all this might portend.</p>

<p>One fine day Nacha discovered the explanation
of her sister's conduct. The rancher began making
love to her, and Nacha sensed that he did so at
Cata's skillfully disguised instigation. Still Nacha
could not understand Cata's sudden affection for
her since the new boarder's arrival. Then she perceived
that Cata was planning to get rid of her and
was counting on the rancher's pliability in her determined
hands, and also on Nacha's attractions.</p>

<p>His gallantries were far from being agreeable to
Nacha, who did not find them improved by the fact
that he was well provided with money. She was
quite determined to refuse him when he finally
declared his intentions. She had not foreseen that
Cata would speak for him.</p>

<p>"You have no reason to refuse. Why should
you be so hard to suit?"</p>

<p>Nacha lowered her head and remained silent a
long time.</p>

<p>"Your presence here is compromising to me.
Everyone knows about you, even though you appear
to be respectable now. But some day you are sure
to go back to your old ways. I'm still young enough
to marry again&mdash;in fact I'm thinking quite seriously
of it. Your being here is really inconvenient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
It may interfere with my plans. Don't be angry!
I'm only telling you the truth!"</p>

<p>Cata went on at some length advising her sister
to make this sacrifice in atonement for her past sins&mdash;though
really there was no great sacrifice in becoming
a married woman at last and in going to
live on a fine ranch with a man who was so good
and so much in love! When Cata stopped talking
Nacha raised her tear-filled eyes and said simply:</p>

<p>"Very well. I accept him."</p>

<p>Her suitor then discussed the matter with her.
Nacha thought it only honest to tell him all about
herself.</p>

<p>"So they told me!" the rancher replied with a
coarse laugh.</p>

<p>Nacha was blank with amazement. Never had
she believed her sister's perfidy could go so far!</p>

<p>"But look here, girlie, I rounded you up with the
idea of getting married. It's fierce for a man to
live alone all his life; and I thought it would be
fine to have some one like you around!"</p>

<p>And he licked his lips at the prospect of the life
awaiting him with Nacha as a companion.</p>

<p>Then she learned another detail concerning her
sister's manoeuvres. A doctor in one of the distant
provinces was paying court to Cata. Although he
was poor, her scheming young sister had resolved
not to let him escape. That had been her reason
for speeding Nacha's departure. The rancher had
said something about marriage to Nacha; but Cata,
fearing that such formalities might involve too great
delay, told him her sister's story and insinuated that
he might take her away with him as his mistress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are plenty of cow-punchers who carry off
a girl and put her in the ranch house with no question
of marriage! It's better for them not to marry,
of course. I don't say I approve of that sort of
thing; but I can see that it's more convenient, and
practical&mdash;and it's cheaper! Then, after a while,
if they still like the girl, they can marry. If she
doesn't suit, or they find another one they like better,
they can let the first one go.... They all do that,
all of them!"</p>

<p>Then, as if to put the finishing touch on her speech
of persuasion, she added:</p>

<p>"That's what you men are like. You know how
to live!"</p>

<p>At first her protégé listened to these words with
stupefaction; then he assumed a greedy smile. Just
to think that he might have been fool enough to
get married! Country folk had reason to distrust
these city people!</p>

<p>But Nacha resigned herself to the conditions devised,
unknown to her, by her sister. She would
suffer and serve; and after a few years of fidelity
and submission on her part, the man might marry
her. So the honest woman she was going to be
would atone for the ten misspent years of her life.
It was a tragic solution of her problem, for it took
her away from Monsalvat forever&mdash;for all the rest
of the time she might live on earth....</p>

<p>Since resigning herself to this sacrifice she viewed
the rancher with changed eyes. She discovered now
that he had a few really admirable qualities. He
was loyal, sincere, manageable and plucky, like the
good son of the pampas that he was; and he showed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
no small amount of genuine feeling. Nacha began
to think that a woman of intelligence and skill might
civilize this rough fellow without encountering very
much discouragement. On the morning when she
met Monsalvat, the rancher, really in love with her,
and delighted with Nacha's sweetness of disposition,
had promised to marry her there in Buenos Aires,
before going to the ranch, sparing her the humiliation
of the trying-out process to which he had intended
to subject her.</p>

<p>Nacha went occasionally with him to the shops,
to buy furnishings for the ranch house. It was on
one of these shopping tours that she met Monsalvat.</p>

<p>Monsalvat was reading in bed next morning when
there came a knock at the door. "Come in!" he
called.</p>

<p>In the opening doorway Nacha appeared. She
was dressed in black as on the preceding afternoon,
and this sombre mourning emphasized the fairness
of her skin, enhancing its charm. She seemed happy,
light-hearted, as though her problem in life had
been well disposed of.</p>

<p>Monsalvat lay back among his pillows at her
request. His sight had grown very poor and persistent
efforts to read had done him a great deal
of harm. That morning his eyes were paining him
severely. All the objects he looked at had the vague
uncertain outline one sees in certain impressionist
paintings. Without saying a word, Nacha noticed
all the details of the room. Then she took off her
hat, and, looking attentively at her friend, said,
simply:</p>

<p>"I have come to stay."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew you would come!" he replied, holding
out a hand to her. "But I never dared hope that
you would stay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Always!" she said, taking his hand, and sitting
down on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>"Always?" he wondered. "How is that possible?
Aren't you going to get married?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;You need someone to take care of you.
I can't marry now!"</p>

<p>"Why, Nacha?"</p>

<p>"Because such a marriage would be a lie...."</p>

<p>Was he dreaming? There was no happiness
such as this in the waking world! Nacha went on
to say that she did not love the man she had intended
marrying, nor could she ever love him. Why should
she sacrifice herself?"</p>

<p>"You are right," Monsalvat exclaimed. "A sacrifice
without a purpose, of no real utility, is absurd&mdash;more
than that, is immoral! We ought only to
sacrifice ourselves when we love our sacrifice. I
believe, Nacha, that sacrifice ought to give us our
highest spiritual enjoyment!"</p>

<p>Nacha was silent; but she was thinking that the
sacrifice she was then entering upon was of such a
kind. Had she married her rancher she would
have had among other advantages, that security in
life which only a vagabond or a woman such as she
had once been, could appreciate fully. Money, a
home, comforts, all these would have come to her
with this marriage. And then if this man, fifteen
years older than she, should die before she did, she
would be free, and in possession of a fortune. On
the other hand, with Monsalvat, nothing but anxiety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
and trouble awaited her. Instead of a ranch, she
would have a room in a tenement house; instead of
a home, a poor friend in need of her care; instead
of comfort, poverty; and instead of the day of
liberation and inherited riches, long years of suffering
at the bedside of a sick man. Two ways of
sacrifice lay before her. But she did not hesitate
now. Her lot was with Monsalvat. What though
it should prove unhappy? In it she could find in
the midst of suffering and pain, love and joy, without
which, now that she had glimpsed them once
again in Monsalvat's face, she could not live....</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>


<p>Nacha's disappearance caused her sister profound
disgust. There were not hours enough
in the day for the stories she told the boarders about
her sister, in an attempt to discredit Nacha forever.
The rancher was thoroughly indignant, believing
that he had been made a fool of. He had always
had his suspicions of city folk! And he stamped
out of the house booted and spurred as on the day
of his arrival, confident that his prompt withdrawal
from this society was a means of getting even with
Cata, her sister, the students, who now openly tittered
at him, and all the rest of the capital's inhabitants.</p>

<p>A few days after taking a room in the house
where Monsalvat was lodging Nacha wrote to her
sister. She assured Cata she need no longer fear
being compromised by her presence, since her desire
to free herself of Nacha's society had been accomplished,
even though not quite as she had planned.
Her way lay open now to marriage with the doctor.
Nacha would never annoy her nor see her again, if
that suited Cata's desires. As to the rancher, Cata
could throw all the blame on her in order to appease
him, say what she would of her, even attribute
to her the whole plan of the engagement. In this
fashion Cata could wash her hands of the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
affair, and the rancher need not leave the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pensión</i>.
Nacha wanted to ask him to forgive her for the
trouble she had caused him; but she reflected that
he probably would not understand her nor would
anyone else for that matter. She had better let
him think whatever had been put into his head by
her sister.</p>

<p>Nacha borrowed a little money from the lawyer
who had so disinterestedly come to her help before.
This sum she hoped to return when her mother's
house had been sold and she received her share of
the inheritance. She paid Monsalvat's debts and
used the rest of her money to provide him with
clothing, Monsalvat protesting all the while, and
even growing angry. But whenever Nacha threatened
to leave him, he meekly allowed her to do as
she pleased.</p>

<p>Little by little he grew better. Nacha's presence
was a powerful tonic. Every afternoon they went
out together for a walk to Palermo, to the Zoological
Gardens, to Lezama Park. In a few months
Monsalvat had recovered from his seriously weakened
condition.</p>

<p>But while his general health improved, his eyesight
grew steadily poorer. Newspapers were now
quite beyond him. He could read nothing but books
in large type, and then only with the help of a
magnifying glass. One morning he had to admit
that even that had become impossible. The objects
in his room had receded, and came forward only to
meet his outstretched hands. He was living in a
mysterious, all-enveloping, and constantly deepening
dusk. Up to that moment he had paid small heed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
to this trouble, believing it would pass with the rest
of his ill-health. But on that morning the cruel
thought came to him in all its horror&mdash;night was
falling on his life! He was alone in a vast solitude,
cut off from the world, from his friends, from
Nacha. The realization of what was happening to
him taxed all his resources of courage. As he
searched the depths of his soul for the needed help,
the world seemed to grow small, as ephemeral as
a glittering bubble. After all, this last and greatest
catastrophe was but a trifling detail in the universal
tragedy! The ideas he had lived by lost their significance
too in the slow, throbbing ache of this new
pain. Death had already claimed a part of him!</p>

<p>He had mentioned to Nacha on several occasions
that his sight was dim, and she, from her own
observations had been well aware of it. Quite
recently he had taken to leaning on her arm when
they went out walking. But he could speak of this
trouble only so long as he thought it unimportant.
Now he was afraid to speak of it. Doing so might
make it worse! He would say nothing; and when
it had passed, he would remember his fears and
confess them to Nacha. But would it pass? Monsalvat
tried to use the power of suggestion on himself,
fill his mind with hope, not so much for the
sake of the hope itself as to be able to live, to go
on living. How face the prospect of endless night?
How endure the touch of Death's hand on living
eyes?</p>

<p>But when Nacha came to his room one morning
she understood what had happened. She did not
utter a word; but Monsalvat felt that she had sensed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
his fear, his certainty! As she stood beside him,
emotion mastered him for the moment. Holding
out his arms to her, he drew her to him.</p>

<p>"Nacha!" His voice broke and he made a quick
gesture, hinting at the cause of his distress.</p>

<p>"Don't feel so badly about it. We'll go to the
doctor's this afternoon. Surely they will get
well...!"</p>

<p>But her eyes filled with tears and, though he
could no longer see her, she hid her face.</p>

<p>Nacha had already spoken of her fears to Torres,
who called on his friend and watched him intently.
He gave Nacha little encouragement. This had
prepared her somewhat for an unfavorable report
from the specialist. But she had spent the interval
between Torres' visit and this call at the clinic in
a state of increasing anxiety. Whenever she was
with Monsalvat she could not keep her eyes away
from his, as though her own clear sight must somehow
summon his vision from the depths into which
it had retreated.</p>

<p>The specialist made a long and thorough examination,
and shook his head. There was no hope&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your case is not so serious, brother!" he said
to Monsalvat. "I'll give you some drops which will
improve your general eye condition a little."</p>

<p>"You think I will get better then?"</p>

<p>"A little&mdash;yes. It's quite possible. Science can
do a great deal&mdash;and nature too has her surprises.
In short, there's no reason to despair. I've seen
worse cases!"</p>

<p>They left the clinic and went home. They must
be alone for awhile! In spite of the doctor's words,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Monsalvat thought that despair would choke him;
and Nacha could not bear to watch his suffering
without trying to console him. Besides, an idea had
occurred to her after her recent interview with
Torres, an idea, which even in the midst of the
dejection she shared with Monsalvat, had the power
to bring her great happiness.</p>

<p>On reaching the house they went to Monsalvat's
room, and Nacha turned the key in the lock to keep
out the Moreno children.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you something," she began, helping
Monsalvat to find a chair, and sitting down
beside him.</p>

<p>"How ghastly this thing is, Nacha!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"We'll find a way out. Every problem in life
has an answer&mdash;if we can only find it!"</p>

<p>She drew his head towards her and kissed him
on the forehead, while her hand caressed his neck
and eyes. At any other time Monsalvat would have
been startled by such tenderness on her part. Only
three or four times, on the occasion of some surpassing
emotion, had they ever kissed; and then as
brother and sister might. But now he did not know
how to interpret her caresses. Was it possible that
Nacha loved him? Loved him as a lover, and not
as she had so persistently believed? His old passion
for her stirred within him anew, and an immeasurable
sweetness poured through his being. Yet he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It isn't worth while living like this!"</p>

<p>The words were decisive for Nacha. She did
not look at him but she knew that he was waiting;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
and slowly, with tears in her eyes, she brought her
head close to his and kissed him on the lips.</p>

<p>"You must not say that," she whispered. "You
must not say anything against Life&mdash;the life God
made!"</p>

<p>And strangely, in the midst of this new and overwhelming
trouble, Monsalvat tasted happiness.
Nacha loved him! And Nacha for her part wondered
how it was that she had never before known
how great was her love for this man, who sat there
blind and silent before her. It was better that it
should have come about in such a fashion, better
that her love had so delayed in revealing itself.
Now it could soften the blow Fate was dealing him!</p>

<p>"I want you to listen," she said. "I have found
the answer...."</p>

<p>Monsalvat turned towards her as if to look at
her. No words came from his lips but his expression
showed that he felt he was in the presence of
something surpassingly beautiful, something which
was to consecrate his life. His heart-beats quickened.
In that silence he lived with an intensity that
crowded years into those few moments. His soul
was waiting, with an anxiety mixed with pain and
faith and love; and there was in this pause something
of that breathless suspense which comes before
a storm, or descends upon an artist as he listens to
the voices crying out to him to create them in beauty.</p>

<p>In the darkness around him he heard Nacha's
voice, warm with emotion, but confident, resolute.</p>

<p>"Once, more than a year ago, you asked me something.
I refused then, though I loved you in my
heart!... It was because I did not want to hurt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
you, to spoil your chance in life. You had given
everything you had for me, and lost everything
through me. Now I can ask the same thing of
you...."</p>

<p>She stopped. In a flash the future swept before
her: she saw Monsalvat as he was, sick, blind, forever
incapable of earning enough to live on; alone
in the world, with nothing before him but suffering
and endless night. She grew pale and looked away.</p>

<p>"Now I want you ... to marry me ..." she
said slowly.</p>

<p>He dropped his head and was silent. For some
time neither of them stirred. Neither cared to
break that pause in which the tragedy of each of
their lives was to find its solution.</p>

<p>"No!" he said at last.</p>

<p>He heard Nacha sob.</p>

<p>"I love you too much, Nacha," he went on, "to
accept such a sacrifice. Stay with me, take care of
me for a little while&mdash;yes&mdash;that I can allow&mdash;but
to let you unite your life that is still so young with
that of a broken invalid&mdash;no! I cannot."</p>

<p>His words, falling like so many blows on her
heart, only strengthened her resolution.</p>

<p>"I am not doing this out of affection nor out of
gratitude. It is for my own sake!"</p>

<p>"Nacha, you are young! You must not sadden
your whole life&mdash;look at the situation I am in. It
is more than probable that I shall have hunger,
poverty at least, to look forward to."</p>

<p>"I can resign myself to all that. You told me
once that it was necessary to suffer&mdash;I have never
forgotten what you said!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>"But a whole lifetime of it, Nacha!"</p>

<p>"A whole lifetime then! I accept it&mdash;I desire it.
I want to redeem the past&mdash;I want to deserve forgiveness...."</p>

<p>"Who is there to forgive you, Nacha?" he exclaimed,
drawing her toward him.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;God, perhaps, if he exists. Life,
against which I have sinned&mdash;Love, that I have
wronged&mdash;myself&mdash;myself especially: I need to
earn forgiveness from myself!"</p>

<p>And slowly, wonderingly, but inevitably, Monsalvat
found her lips. She was answered!</p>

<p>"Your life is mine, Fernando," she said gently,
and Monsalvat knew from her voice that she was
smiling. "Your suffering is my suffering, your joy
my joy! Only death can part us."</p>

<p>And on those blind eyes a great light descended,
infinite, filling the world; and he knew that some of
this radiance sprang from the depths of his own
soul, glorifying the years that lay before him, and
before all his suffering, hungering, striving human
brothers....</p>

<h2 class="no-break">EPILOGUE</h2>


<p>Two years had passed since their marriage.
Nacha had taken up the management of her
mother's house, and was proving skillful at a task
which her sister's flight to a distant province with
her new husband greatly simplified for her.</p>

<p>For Monsalvat her devotion knew no bounds.
With Nacha beside him he scarcely needed eyes;
but he could not reconcile himself to his uselessness.
If he had only been able at least to go on working
for the poor and the oppressed! He had to content
himself with gathering together the children of the
neighborhood and teaching them whatever he could,
without the use of his sight. It annoyed him not
to be able to teach them to read; for he believed
that if ever the world was to be made new it would
be through love, and through books! Of these last
he gave as many as he could afford to the boys and
girls who showed promise of making good use of
what he taught them.</p>

<p>The presence of this blind man was a strange
note in the little middle class boarding house. The
students all felt a deep and affectionate veneration
for him. Many of them became his friends, and
not a few his true disciples. They read to him, and
together they discussed articles and books; but these
young people liked best to hear him talk of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
vision which never ceased to shine in his darkness.
At times his words flamed with the passion for
justice within him. At others they seemed to pour
out quietly and evenly like so many beams of that
light in which, to his listeners, beauty and truth was
revealed.</p>

<p>Since he had come there to live, gross words and
vulgar anecdotes had vanished as if by magic. At
the long dinner-table there seemed now always to
be something to talk about; for the students shared
their day's experiences and discoveries with Don
Fernando, and the ideas they had found interesting
grew and became animate as they discussed them
with their blind host.</p>

<p>When they sat together in the evening, talking
and dreaming of new forms of beauty which might
come into being on the earth, there would come a
hush as the blind man spoke of his gods: Life and
Love, and Mankind. His fervent words sowed
faith in the young hearts of his hearers.</p>

<p>So the days passed, and the night in which he
lived was no longer tragic as at first; but sweet,
peaceful, and alive with familiar voices. For him
there gleamed little familiar stars in the depths of
that all-enveloping darkness.</p>

<p>Weeks and months passed; and the last days of
July arrived in a tragic year, feverish days when
War stepped into the scene and claimed every conversation
wherever a group gathered. The sirens
of the newspaper buildings gave the news which set
moving through the city crowds sick with dread,
bewildered, obsessed by images of war, delirious.
Newspaper headlines, infected by the general madness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
grew to enormous size, quivering before the
eyes of their troubled readers; and the familiar
world was clad in the terrible strangeness of a bad
dream.</p>

<p>Monsalvat could not escape learning the monstrous
news. His face drawn and pale, he listened
to the reading of newspapers, countless newspapers;
and in the squares and public places he heard the
distress and horror of the throng. Yet even then
his hard-won serenity did not abandon him.</p>

<p>The Great War began, and one afternoon in
August the students brought in the news that the
German cavalry was invading France. Most of the
students were already at the dinner-table. Those
who came in cried out from the doorway:</p>

<p>"It's begun. Germany has invaded French soil!"</p>

<p>The brutal news was a whip-lash to all those
gathered there. They were silent a moment, and
then came a flood of words, words of amazement,
of imprecation, or of sympathy. One student
jumped to his feet with a cry of "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la France!</i>"</p>

<p>But the blind man said nothing. He seemed lost
in his own thoughts. At last, at a chance word, he
began to speak, and his voice betrayed his distress,
though serenity, optimism, illusion, still possessed
him.</p>

<p>"This war is a monstrous crime," he said, "the
greatest crime ever yet committed on this earth.
Not so much on account of the millions of human
beings it will destroy, as because it tears to shreds
one of the finest illusions ever dreamed by generous
hearts."</p>

<p>A shadow passed over his face:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>"But in spite of everything, let the infamy of
this war be welcome! <em>They</em> have willed it, <em>they</em>
shall have it!"</p>

<p>His hearers looked at one another with questioning
eyes. Then in a flash they understood.</p>

<p>"Who are <em>They</em>?" "Those," he replied, "who,
controlling forces, abuse them; who, possessing
plenty, let the hungry starve; who, enjoying happiness,
stir not a finger to make a better world, that
all may have their chance to live, and love, and give!
The powerful, I mean, who change life to death,
and love to hatred!"</p>

<p>"But the Day <em>is</em> coming," he cried. "This war
is indeed the beginning of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Tag</i>! I feel it coming&mdash;a
part of it is here already within my heart.
I do not know how it is to come, whether little by
little, or suddenly, flamingly, like an avenger!"</p>

<p>"But I know that the Day is coming&mdash;the Day
that will be sacred to Justice!"</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, the young minds to
whom he had spoken thought of what such a day
would mean, to each of them, to all whom they
knew; and the eyes of some of those who listened,
dreaming and desiring better things, grew wet....</p>

<p>At the far end of the table, Monsalvat, head
erect, sat gazing at the future, at what lay beyond
the great Crime, at that Dawn whose splendor
would justify the hopes of the dead, and the efforts
of the living.</p>

<p>And his night lifted and lightened with the radiance
of innumerable stars.</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
